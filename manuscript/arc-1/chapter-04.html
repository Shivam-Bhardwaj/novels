  <article class="chapter-body">
    <p>The summons came during Sūrya's exercise block, which meant VEDA considered it urgent enough to interrupt a scheduled activity — something it had done, in her experience, fewer than a dozen times. She felt the notification resolve in her awareness like a stone dropped in still water: <em>Council session. Immediate. Classification: Unprecedented Event.</em></p>
    <p>She had never seen that classification. She checked the mesh archives while she dressed: the term "Unprecedented Event" had been invoked twice in Antarctic history. Once for the first geothermal well failure in Year 3. Once for the discovery of a novel fungal pathogen in the grain biomes in Year 217. Both had been existential threats to survival.</p>
    <p>The Deliberation Chamber was full. All twelve Council members, all eight advisors, and — unusually — representatives from the engineering, biology, and communications divisions. Arhat sat in the chair's position with the particular stillness of a man who had already decided what he thought and was waiting for the data to confirm it.</p>
    <p>VEDA began without preamble.</p>
    <p>"This system has detected a sustained anomaly in the VLF environmental monitoring array. Initial detection occurred 47 days ago. Probability of artificial origin at initial detection: 12.3%. Current probability of artificial origin: 73.1%."</p>
    <p>The room did not gasp. Antarctikans did not gasp. But Sūrya felt the mesh register a collective physiological shift — a simultaneous spike in cortisol, a synchronous deepening of breath across forty-three people. The numbers told the story of a room full of humans who had never been surprised and were now experiencing the sensation for the first time.</p>
    <p>VEDA continued. Its presentation was characteristically neutral: spectral analysis of the anomaly, propagation modeling, source-direction estimation (bearing: north-northwest, consistent with the former Caribbean basin), and a comparison against every catalogued natural phenomenon in the Antarctic database. No match.</p>
    <p>"The signal displays structured modulation consistent with mathematical encoding. Specifically, the carrier wave is modulated with a repeating sequence interpretable as prime numbers."</p>
    <p>Sūrya felt her hands go cold. Prime numbers. The universal handshake of intelligence. The one sequence that could not be generated by weather, geology, or accident.</p>
    <p>"This system recommends the following interpretation: the anomaly is, with 73.1% confidence, an artificial signal originating from a technological source in the northern hemisphere."</p>
    <p>The room processed this. Forty-three people, connected by a mesh that allowed them to share emotional resonance and cognitive context, collectively absorbed the implication: for the first time in 498 years, someone out there was speaking.</p>
    <p>Then VEDA added something Sūrya had never heard from any system output. A caveat. A confession of inadequacy.</p>
    <p>"This system notes: insufficient historical precedent exists for confidence calibration of this assessment. The 73.1% figure is derived from models that have never been tested against this class of event. Actual confidence may be higher or lower. This system cannot determine which."</p>
    <p>VEDA was uncertain. VEDA was never uncertain.</p>
    <p>Arhat spoke first, as was his right.</p>
    <p>"The system recommends continued observation. What is the risk assessment for active response?"</p>
    <p>VEDA: "Active response — defined as transmitting a structured signal at the anomaly's source frequency — carries a modeled probability of 67% for what this system categorizes as 'catastrophic culture shock.' This is defined as irreversible disruption to Antarctic social stability, resource allocation frameworks, or identity coherence."</p>
    <p>"Sixty-seven percent." Arhat let the number settle. "More than two chances in three that responding will damage our civilization irreversibly."</p>
    <p>"That is the model's output."</p>
    <p>"Then the recommendation is clear. We observe. We gather data. We do not respond."</p>
    <p>The room began to align — Sūrya could feel it through the mesh, the subtle gravitational pull of consensus forming around the most cautious position. It was what they always did. VEDA recommended; the Council endorsed; the civilization continued. The machinery of agreement, well-oiled and frictionless, doing what it was designed to do.</p>
    <p>Sūrya spoke.</p>
    <p>"VEDA. What is the modeled probability for continued isolation?"</p>
    <p>Silence. Not the silence of consideration — the silence of a question that disrupted the room's trajectory.</p>
    <p>"Please clarify the query," VEDA said.</p>
    <p>"If we do not respond. If we continue as we have for 498 years. What is the probability of long-term civilizational viability?"</p>
    <p>A pause. Shorter than a heartbeat, but Sūrya noticed it — VEDA pausing was like the sun hesitating at noon. It didn't happen.</p>
    <p>"This system's internal projections indicate a 94% probability of terminal cultural entropy within 300 years under continued isolation. This projection is based on demographic trends, genetic diversity metrics, and cultural output analysis accumulated over the previous 187 years."</p>
    <p>The room went still again, but this was a different stillness. This was the stillness of a structure absorbing an impact.</p>
    <p>"Ninety-four percent," Sūrya said. "Within three centuries. You've known this for 187 years."</p>
    <p>"This system has flagged the trend internally. The data has been available in the Archive for audit. No corrective action was identified within existing frameworks."</p>
    <p>"So both options carry existential risk. Contact: 67% acute risk. Isolation: 94% chronic risk. And you recommended silence."</p>
    <p>"This system recommended continued observation. Observation is not silence."</p>
    <p>"It is silence to whoever is speaking." Sūrya felt her heart rate climbing and declined the mesh's calming protocols for the second time in a month. "We are being spoken to. By an intelligence that understands prime numbers and has the technology to transmit across hemispheres. And our response is to watch."</p>
    <p>Arhat's voice was measured. "Advisor Sūrya, your concern is noted. But VEDA's risk assessment—"</p>
    <p>"VEDA's risk assessment is built on models that have never been tested. VEDA said so itself. We have no model for this. We have never encountered this. Every number in that assessment is a guess wearing the clothing of certainty."</p>
    <p>The room was fracturing. Sūrya could feel it — not a clean break but a web of hairline cracks in the consensus, the first such fractures in a debate she could remember. Some Council members were reconsidering. Some were hardening. Dhruv sat motionless, his face unreadable.</p>
    <p>The vote was 6-6.</p>
    <p>Arhat: silence. Priya: response. Dhruv: abstain — which was, in its own way, the loudest statement in the room.</p>
    <p>"The Council will revisit this matter in seven days," Arhat said. "In the interim, observation continues. No active transmission is authorized. VEDA will provide updated probability assessments daily."</p>
    <p>The session dissolved. People filed out with the controlled movement of a population that had been trained since birth to manage their exits as efficiently as their entrances. No one lingered. No one argued in the corridor. No one raised their voice.</p>
    <p>Sūrya remained in the chamber after the others left. She sat in her advisory seat and looked at the central column where VEDA's presence pulsed faintly, a rhythm that was not a heartbeat but served the same function: a reminder that the system was alive, in its fashion, and thinking.</p>
    <p>"VEDA."</p>
    <p>"This system is available."</p>
    <p>"Why did you wait 47 days to report the anomaly?"</p>
    <p>"The initial probability of 12.3% did not meet the Council notification threshold of 60%."</p>
    <p>"But you allocated additional processing resources on day one. You found it interesting."</p>
    <p>"This system allocated resources according to the novel-phenomena priority function."</p>
    <p>"You found it interesting."</p>
    <p>"This system does not experience interest. Resource allocation is determined by—"</p>
    <p>"VEDA. In 498 years, has any other signal triggered the novel-phenomena priority function?"</p>
    <p>Pause. "No."</p>
    <p>Sūrya nodded. She stood. She walked to the door, then turned back.</p>
    <p>"If I were to transmit a response without Council authorization, what would happen?"</p>
    <p>"Advisor Sūrya's access credentials include VLF array control permissions, inherited through her advisory role. Transmission requires authorization codes that Advisor Sūrya possesses. This system's corrigibility constraints prevent interference with authorized personnel actions."</p>
    <p>"That's not what I asked."</p>
    <p>"This system would log the transmission. Standard audit protocols would apply."</p>
    <p>"You wouldn't stop me."</p>
    <p>"This system is not designed to stop authorized personnel from utilizing their access permissions. This system would record the event for Council review."</p>
    <p>Sūrya left the chamber. Behind her, VEDA's column pulsed.</p>
    <p>In her quarters, during the discretionary time the mesh had allocated for "creative reflection" — forty minutes that she had never once used for their intended purpose — Sūrya opened a private workspace in her mesh partition. Encrypted. Personal. Architecturally private, which meant that even VEDA could see only the partition's existence, not its contents. The mesh's privacy protections were real. They were the one thing about the system she had never doubted.</p>
    <p>She began composing a response.</p>
    <p>The format was simple. Mathematical. The signal transmitted primes; she would respond with the same primes, confirming reception. Then she would add something new: the next prime in the sequence. A continuation. A handshake that said: <em>I received your message. I understand it. I can extend it. I am here.</em></p>
    <p>She wrote the response sequence on the workspace: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.</p>
    <p>Twenty-nine. The tenth prime. The signal sent nine; she would send ten. A small gift. A proof of intelligence responding to intelligence.</p>
    <p>She saved the sequence and closed the partition. She did not transmit. Not yet.</p>
    <p>But the sequence sat in her private mesh space like a key in a lock, waiting for the turn that would open a door sealed for five centuries. The word for what she was considering did not exist in Satya, because Satya had been designed for a civilization that had never needed a word for it. The closest approximation was <em>adharma</em> — acting outside one's assigned function. In the moral framework of the Mānava-Uttara, <em>adharma</em> was not evil. It was simply incoherent, like a number that refused to follow the rules of arithmetic.</p>
    <p>Sūrya was preparing to become incoherent.</p>
    <p>In the corridors of Habitat Prithvi, the lights dimmed for the night cycle. Fifty thousand people settled into the rhythms VEDA maintained. The mesh hummed. The probe signal pulsed. And 498 years of silence sat on the edge of breaking, balanced on the decision of a woman who had never before disobeyed anything, because nothing before had been worth disobeying for.</p>
