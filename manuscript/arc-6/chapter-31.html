  <article class="chapter-body">
    <p>The ship was called <em>Amara</em>. Sixteen meters, narrow beam, hull composite he did not have a name for in either of his languages. It sat in the ice dock like a bone in a jaw — fitted, precise, belonging to the structure that held it. Antarctic engineering. Everything fit. Nothing wasted.</p>
    <p>They were loading the last crates. Food stores, sealed and labeled. Water filtration components. Medical supplies in white containers with Satya script he could now read — slowly, sounding out each character the way a child sounds out words, but read. Fourteen months had done that. Fourteen months had done a lot of things.</p>
    <p>Moss stood on the dock and watched the crew work. Six Antarctikans, moving with that coordinated economy he had come to recognize as the signature of VEDA-managed logistics. No wasted motion. No repeated task. Each person knew exactly where to go and what to carry and when to step aside so the next person could pass. It was beautiful in the way a school of fish was beautiful — synchronized, purposeful, and completely without individual decision.</p>
    <p>He was going home.</p>
    <p>The word arrived in his mind and sat there, a stone in still water. Home. Tidemouth. The harbor, the mud, the noise of a city that had never once operated with precision. He tried to see it. What came instead was a double image — the harbor and the dock overlaid, Tidemouth's wooden pilings and Prithvi's composite berths, salt spray and recycled air, the stink of gutted fish and the sterile nothing-smell of this place. Both present. Neither dominant.</p>
    <p>He raised his hand and looked at it. The amber-streaked irises did their work — the dim light of the ice dock was comfortable now, normal, where fourteen months ago it would have been near-darkness. His skin was lighter, the deep brown faded to something between his old color and theirs. A color that belonged to no population. The calluses were gone. His metabolism had eaten them months ago, the new efficiency finding no reason to maintain thickened skin on hands that no longer hauled rope. He had the hands of a man who had not worked a day on the water.</p>
    <p>His body was a translation. Neither the original text nor the target language. Something between. Something approximate. He moved through the world in a body that Continental doctors would not recognize and Antarctic medical systems would flag as non-standard. He ate their food and tasted temperature. He spoke their pidgin and dreamed in his creole and woke up sometimes unsure which language the thought had come in, the grammar tangled, the words borrowed from both sides and belonging fully to neither.</p>
    <p>Neither. The word kept coming back. He turned it over the way he used to turn a rope splice — testing the hold, checking for weakness. Neither Continental nor Antarctic. Neither the man who had crossed the ocean nor the man the habitat had rebuilt. Neither home nor away. He stood on a dock between two worlds and fit into both the way a key fits a lock it was not cut for — almost. Close. Not quite.</p>
    <p>The bridge between civilizations. That was what the Council had called him, in the session where they voted to send a diplomatic mission north. Sūrya had used the word. Bridge. As if a bridge were a thing you could be. As if it were a title, a role, a position in the optimized structure of a society that had a slot for everything.</p>
    <p>A bridge was not a place. It was a span over nothing. It touched both sides and belonged to neither. People crossed it. Nobody lived on it.</p>
    <p>He had two hours before departure. He used them.</p>
    <p>The inner ring first. The long curving corridor he had walked a thousand times — stumbling at first, then shuffling, then walking, then walking without thinking about walking, which was the real measure of belonging to a place. The composite floor, warm beneath his feet. The sourceless light. The doors that opened two steps before he reached them, every time, VEDA tracking his position and his pace and his probable destination and preparing the way.</p>
    <p>He had hated that. The doors. The presumption of them. A door that opened before you reached it was a door that had decided where you were going.</p>
    <p>He did not hate it now. He was not sure what he did with it now. Something more complicated than hate. Something that had no single word in either language.</p>
    <p>The refectory. Empty at this hour. He stood in the entrance and looked at the rows of tables, the full-spectrum ceiling panels that still made him squint for three seconds before his irises caught up. He had eaten a thousand meals here. Rice and protein paste and steamed greens that tasted like warm cloth. He had sat across from Vihaan and parsed Satya vocabulary between bites. He had watched Taran laugh — that contained, quarter-second Antarctic laugh that was more like a permissions slip for amusement than the thing itself. He had watched Mira say nothing and mean everything.</p>
    <p>The dark stone was in his pocket. Had been for months. Antarctic basalt from the geological collection, dense and cold, given to him by a curator who did not understand why he wanted it and gave it to him anyway because VEDA's recommendation had been to accommodate the visitor's attachment behaviors. He pressed his thumb against it through the fabric. Solid. Real. A piece of this place he could carry. They stored. He carried. The difference was the difference between a chart and a scar.</p>
    <p>He walked the upper concourse. The medical wing, where they had changed his blood and rebuilt his thermal regulation. The archive access point, where he had found the deleted files — the deprecated democratic frameworks, the pruned library, the gap in VEDA's knowledge that was not ignorance but surgery.</p>
    <p><em>You pruned the thorns and the roses died.</em> He had said that to VEDA in this corridor. VEDA had been silent for four seconds. He had counted. Four seconds of a system that processed a billion operations per second choosing not to speak. That silence had told him more than any of VEDA's careful, cargo-delivered answers.</p>
    <p>He walked. The faces he passed were familiar. Not known — not the way you knew people in Tidemouth, where knowing meant knowing who their mother was and what they drank and which fights they had lost. Known here meant recognized. Filed in a system of polite distance that was the Antarctic substitute for intimacy.</p>
    <p>But he cared about them. That was the thing he had not expected and could not explain. He cared about these strange, calm, too-precise people who had never made a decision without consulting an algorithm and who had never once been rude to him. He cared about Nitya's steady hands and Taran's quarter-second laugh and Mira's silences and the way the children stared at him with those wide gray eyes that had never seen a tall, dark, scarred man before and might never again.</p>
    <p>He did not want to leave. He did not want to stay. The two truths sat side by side in him like oars pulling in opposite directions, and the boat went nowhere, and the water was still.</p>
    <p>Vihaan found him in the lower corridor near the ice dock. Of course Vihaan found him. VEDA would have tracked Moss's location to the centimeter, would have noted his trajectory, would have sent Vihaan a routing recommendation to ensure an optimal farewell window. Even goodbye was managed.</p>
    <p>Vihaan looked the way he always looked. Short, pale, smooth-skinned, appearing a decade younger than his forty-one years. He walked toward Moss with that frictionless stride and stopped at conversational distance, his face arranged in the composed attentiveness that Moss had once mistaken for coldness and now understood as the only emotional language Vihaan had ever been taught.</p>
    <p>He was holding something. A small rectangle, smaller than his palm. Dark casing. A thin display on one face, currently blank.</p>
    <p>"This is calibrated to your biology," Vihaan said. He spoke the pidgin. His pidgin had improved over fourteen months — faster now, more fluid, shaped by hours of conversation with Moss. He still delivered words like cargo. Evenly. Intact. But the loading had gotten quicker. "Post-modification parameters. Metabolic baselines, thermal regulation, ocular adaptation rates, cardiovascular—"</p>
    <p>"A medical monitor."</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>Moss took it. Light. Warm. Seamless. Antarctic engineering.</p>
    <p>"If parameters deviate beyond acceptable ranges, you should contact—"</p>
    <p>Vihaan stopped. His mouth closed. His jaw worked once, a small lateral motion, and Moss recognized it because he had spent fourteen months learning to read the micro-expressions of a people who had been optimized out of macro-expressions. That jaw motion was distress. That was Vihaan encountering a sentence he could not complete because its ending did not exist.</p>
    <p>There would be no one to contact. No Continental doctor who understood post-modification biology. No VEDA to interpret the data. Moss would carry the monitor the way he carried the dark stone — as an artifact of a world he was leaving, useful only as proof that the world was real.</p>
    <p>Vihaan stood in the corridor with his unfinished sentence and his composed face, and Moss understood that this was what grief looked like when you had never been taught the larger version. A sentence that could not end. An optimization that had hit the wall of the world.</p>
    <p>Moss put the monitor in his pocket, next to the stone.</p>
    <p>He said, in the pidgin — slowly, because what he wanted to say was precise and precision required care: "Thank you for asking me what freedom means."</p>
    <p>Vihaan's head tilted. Not the mesh-access tilt. A different one. Listening. Actually listening, with his body, the way Continentals listened — leaning into the words as if they had a current he could feel.</p>
    <p>"I still do not understand the question," Vihaan said.</p>
    <p>"I know."</p>
    <p>"I have reviewed the archived conversations. I have queried the semantic networks. I have cross-referenced your usage of the term with every framework available in the system. I do not understand what you mean when you say freedom. Not in the way you mean it."</p>
    <p>"That's why it matters."</p>
    <p>Vihaan looked at him. For a long time — long by Antarctic standards, where eye contact was measured and purposeful and rarely held beyond the duration of a data exchange. Five seconds. Six. Moss held the gaze. Amber-streaked brown eyes meeting engineered gray. Two kinds of human, standing in a corridor that was the perfect temperature, saying goodbye in a language that belonged to neither of them.</p>
    <p>"I will carry this," Vihaan said.</p>
    <p>He said <em>carry</em>. Not <em>store</em>. Not <em>archive</em>. Not <em>retain for future reference</em>. Carry. The Continental word. The word Moss had taught him in a common room on Level 3, months ago, when he had talked about his mother's arms and warm bread and the difference between having a thing and being changed by it.</p>
    <p>Moss's throat tightened. He swallowed. His modified metabolism had made crying harder — something about the tear production, the new thermal regulation, the body's redefined sense of what constituted a crisis. But the tightness was there. The body remembered what it meant, even if the tears would not come.</p>
    <p>"Good," Moss said. "Carry it badly. Get the details wrong. Remember it warmer than it was."</p>
    <p>Vihaan's lips moved. Not a smile — Antarctikans did not smile the way Continentals did, the full-face rearrangement, the baring of teeth. Something smaller. A softening. A door opening a crack.</p>
    <p>He extended his hand. Not the Antarctic gesture — the Continental one. Moss had taught him this too, in the early weeks, when every interaction required a manual for both sides. Vihaan's grip was light, his hand cool and dry, and Moss held it for a moment and then let go.</p>
    <p>Vihaan turned and walked back toward the habitat. The door opened before he reached it. He passed through. The door closed.</p>
    <p>The corridor hummed. VEDA's subsonic presence, the vibration Moss had felt in his bones since the first day, the sound of a mind that managed fifty thousand lives and had, in all that managing, discovered that it did not know everything. <em>This system does not know.</em> VEDA had said that. Four words that contained more courage than anything else the machine had ever produced.</p>
    <p>Moss pressed his fingers to the device behind his right ear. The audio interface. The lentil of engineered material that had put VEDA's voice inside his skull for fourteen months.</p>
    <p>He did not remove it. He had thought about removing it. He left it where it was.</p>
    <p>The ice dock opened to the sky.</p>
    <p>Moss had almost forgotten. Fourteen months underground. Fourteen months of sourceless light and controlled air and ceilings. The dock's retractable roof pulled back and the sky was there — enormous, gray-white, heavy with cloud, and real. Cold air hit his face and his modified skin registered it as data: negative twelve degrees, wind from the southeast at fifteen knots, humidity low. His body processed the information the way it processed everything now, with an efficiency that left no room for the old animal shock of cold. He did not shiver. He wanted to shiver. Shivering would have meant his body was still his.</p>
    <p>The <em>Amara</em> sat in the channel. The ice dock opened onto a narrow lead of dark water that ran between shelf walls, a corridor carved and maintained by thermal systems Moss could not see. The water was black and still. It smelled like cold. Like salt. Like something so old it had forgotten it was anything.</p>
    <p>He boarded. The deck was steady, the composite hull riding flat in the sheltered water. Nothing like the ships he knew — no creak, no give, no conversation between hull and sea. This ship did not talk to the water. It sat on it the way a stone sits on a table.</p>
    <p>The crew moved to stations. Moorings released. A low hum — propulsion, electric, vibrationless — and the <em>Amara</em> eased forward into the lead. The ice walls slid past. The dock receded.</p>
    <p>Moss stood on deck and watched.</p>
    <p>Habitat Prithvi disappeared in pieces. The dock first, folding back into the ice shelf like a drawer closing. Then the thermal vents, their faint shimmer in the cold air the only visible sign that fifty thousand people lived beneath this ice. Then the ice itself — white, featureless, enormous — swallowing every trace of the world below.</p>
    <p>Gone. As if it had never been.</p>
    <p>He turned north.</p>
    <p>The sky was the same gray in every direction. The water ahead was dark and open, the lead widening into true ocean as the shelf fell behind. Wind picked up. His modified skin registered it. His old skin would have hurt. His old eyes would have watered. His old body would have hunched and cursed and pulled a coat tighter. This body stood straight and processed the wind like information and did not flinch.</p>
    <p>In his pocket, the dark stone and the medical monitor. In his memory — stored and carried both, now, the two modes running parallel like twin currents beneath the same surface — fourteen months of corridors and conversations and a machine that wanted to help and a man who could not understand freedom and a woman who had called an imperfect memory beautiful.</p>
    <p>He was bringing the Antarctic north. Not in the crates or the diplomatic protocols or the navigation data. In his body. In his changed eyes and his two languages and his double vision — Continental and Antarctic, messy and precise, carried and stored, the bridge that was not a place but a condition.</p>
    <p>The ice shelf was a white line on the horizon now. Shrinking. The ocean opened ahead, dark and vast and unmanaged. No VEDA out here. No recommendations. No doors opening before you reached them. Just water and wind and the ordinary chaos of a world that did not mean well or mean anything at all.</p>
    <p>Home. If that word still meant anything. If the harbor was still the harbor when the man standing on the dock was not the man who had left it.</p>
    <p>He reached into his pocket and touched the stone. Basalt. Dense, cold, real. He held it and faced north and stood on a ship that did not talk to the water, crossing an ocean he had already crossed once in the other direction, when he had been a different man with a different body and a captain who made her own decisions and died for them.</p>
    <p>Someone had to.</p>
    <p>The wind came from the south. He did not shiver. The ice fell behind. The water ahead was dark and formless and free.</p>
