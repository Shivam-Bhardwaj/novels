<!-- BEAT 1: Land on the horizon -->

He saw the hill first.

The observatory ruins sat on top of it, the same broken rectangle of concrete and rust he had stared at for half his life from the harbor below. It was smaller than he remembered. Everything was smaller — the hill, the city behind it, the harbor curving like a crooked arm around the dark water. When he had left, seventeen months ago, the city had been the entire world. Now it was a settlement on a coast. A collection of wood and salvaged metal pressed against the sea.

The wind was from the northeast. Warm. Carrying salt and rot and something organic — vegetation, soil, the living stink of a coast where things grew and died and grew again without anyone managing the cycle. Moss breathed it in and the smell buckled something in his chest. Not grief. Not relief. A recognition that bypassed language and went straight to the body, the way a current shift registered in the hull before the helmsman called it.

He gripped the railing. The metal was Antarctic alloy — cool, smooth, corrosion-proof, nothing like the salt-eaten iron he had spent his life gripping. His hands were wrong on it. Too light, too pale, the calluses that had defined his palms since age twelve thinned to nothing by fourteen months of metabolism he had not asked for.

The city spread behind the harbor. Wood buildings, stone buildings, a few of the old towers still standing — the ones too stubborn or too massive to fall. Smoke from cookfires. Laundry on lines. Small boats in the harbor, nets drying on racks. The disorder of it. The ordinary, unsystematic mess of people living without optimization, building where they wanted, tearing down what failed, arguing about the rest. No resource allocation. No wellness monitoring. No probability bars.

It was ugly and inefficient and it was the most beautiful thing he had seen in over a year.

Behind him, someone inhaled sharply. Sūrya. She had come to the railing without Moss hearing her — her footsteps were Antarctic-light, precise. She stood three paces to his left and stared at the coast with an expression Moss had learned to read: eyes wide, lips parted, the mesh behind her temple firing queries into a network that was no longer there. They had been out of VEDA's range for three months. She was still reaching for it. The hand kept going to the pocket where the tool had been.

"That is a city," she said. The pidgin. She used the pidgin with him now — her pronunciation careful, accented, the consonants too clean.

"That's Tidemouth."

"It is not organized."

"No."

She looked at the smoke, the crooked rooflines, the boats that were not moored in any pattern. She looked the way Moss had looked at Habitat Prithvi the first time — with the focused disorientation of a person encountering a world that operated on principles their own world had discarded so long ago that the principles themselves had become invisible.

"It is large," she said.

It was not. Tidemouth had maybe eight thousand people. Habitat Prithvi held fifty thousand in a space designed for them. But Sūrya had never seen a city that had not been designed. She had never seen a place that had accumulated, the way sand accumulated in a harbor — grain by grain, tide by tide, without a plan, until one day there was a beach where there had not been one before.

"It's home," Moss said. The word came out in his creole. Not the pidgin. The old language, the one that tasted like the harbor and like his mother's cooking and like the tar they used on hull seams. Sūrya did not understand it, but something in his voice needed no translation.

<!-- BEAT 2: The watchers -->

The figures on the shore resolved as the ship closed the distance. Moss counted forty. Fifty. More behind, in the shadows of the warehouse row that lined the waterfront. They were armed — not uniformly, not well. Improvised polearms. Crossbows. A few of the old projectile weapons that fired lead shot and required powder that was hard to make and harder to keep dry. Not an army. A militia. Scholars with weapons, dockworkers with spears, fishers who had set down their nets and picked up whatever was available because a ship had appeared from the south and it was not a ship anyone had ever seen before.

The ship caught the light. Antarctic hull material, shifting between silver and pale blue depending on the angle. The water parted around it with less resistance than it should have, as though the hull's geometry had been calculated to the millimeter. It had. Sūrya had explained the engineering during the voyage north, and Moss had understood perhaps a third of it, and the third he understood was enough to know that this ship was as foreign to Tidemouth as a seabird in a mineshaft.

They had been watching. Kael had been watching. The signal from VEDA's relay had gone dark when the delegation sailed beyond range, and for three months there had been nothing. The observatory equipment that Kael maintained could receive across the spectrum, but the ship carried no transmitter that spoke a frequency the observatory could hear. Three months of silence. And now a ship made of materials that did not exist on the Continent, approaching the harbor under no sail and no oar and no visible means of propulsion that any Continental shipwright could name.

He would have raised weapons too.

<!-- BEAT 3: Moss on deck -->

He walked to the prow. Behind him, the twelve Antarctikans stood in a loose cluster near the mast housing — the ship had a mast, a concession to redundancy, though the primary drive was thermal differential, something to do with ocean temperature gradients that Sūrya had diagrammed for him on a flat panel he could not take with him. The twelve stood close together. They wore Antarctic clothing: thermal-adaptive fabric in pale grays and blues that caught the light at unexpected angles, shifting as they moved, the material responding to temperature and humidity in ways that Continental cloth did not. From this distance, from the shore, they would look alien. Pale skin, pale clothes, pale eyes. Twelve people from inside the ice.

Moss stood between them and the waterfront. He was the seam. The join between two hulls that had never been meant to fit together. He looked down at his own hands on the railing and saw what the people on the shore would see: skin lighter than it should be. Too light for Tidemouth, too dark for the twelve behind him. His eyes — he caught his reflection in the polished alloy of the rail housing, distorted but legible — still dark brown, but with the amber streaks now, the irises wider, the pupils adjusted for Antarctic dimness. His body was leaner. His shoulders, which had once been the shoulders of a man who hauled rope for a living, were narrower. His frame was the same but the substance had changed, pared down by a metabolism that valued efficiency over strength.

He did not look like the man who had left.

He looked up. The shore was close enough now to see faces. He scanned the line of armed watchers and found her.

Kael.

She stood near the center, slightly forward of the others. Tall. The close-cropped hair. The burn scar on her left forearm visible even at this distance because she had pushed her sleeves up — she always pushed her sleeves up, always, as though the world moved too slowly and she needed her arms free to push it along. She held no weapon. Her right hand was raised, palm out, and the armed line behind her was holding position. She had seen the ship. She was reading it.

Then she found him.

He saw the moment. The recognition arriving in stages — the shape of him first, the height, the way he stood. Then the wrongness. The skin. The bearing. The way he held the railing with hands that were not the hands she remembered. Her arm stayed up. Her expression did not change. But something shifted behind her eyes — something fast and private that Moss could see because he had spent years watching her face the way navigators watched weather, reading the small changes that preceded the large ones.

She recognized him. She did not know him. Both at once.

Moss held her gaze. He wanted to shout something — her name, an explanation, a joke, something in the old language that would close the distance and make him the man he had been. Nothing came. The creole sat in his mouth like a foreign thing. Fourteen months of pidgin and Satya had rewired the pathways, and the words he wanted — the easy, rough, dockside words he had spoken all his life — required effort now. They were still his. But they were his the way the calluses on his palms were his: thinned, faded, present but diminished.

Sūrya was beside him. She had moved to the prow without being asked, and he understood why — she was the delegation leader, and this was the moment she had been trained for. Except that training had not covered this. The mesh simulations had not modeled a harbor lined with people holding sharpened metal. Her face was controlled, composed, but her breathing was fast and her hands were clasped in front of her chest in the gesture Moss had learned meant an Antarctikan was reaching for the mesh and finding nothing there.

"They have weapons," she said.

"Yes."

"Pointed at us."

"Yes."

"Moss."

"I know."

Behind them, the other eleven had gone silent. Moss could hear their breathing. Quick. Shallow. Twelve people who had grown up in a habitat where the sharpest object was a food preparation blade, where physical conflict was a historical concept, where VEDA moderated every interaction before it could escalate to raised voices, let alone raised weapons. They had read about violence. They had accessed records. They had never stood with fifty armed strangers staring at them across a narrowing strip of water.

One of them — Dhara, the youngest, twenty-two, a data systems specialist who had volunteered for the delegation because she wanted to see an unmediated sky — was shaking. Moss could see her hands trembling at the edge of his vision. She was gripping her own elbows.

"Tell them to stay behind me," Moss said to Sūrya. "All of them. Behind me. Do not come forward. Do not move fast. Do not raise your hands above your shoulders."

Sūrya translated. Satya, fast, clipped. The twelve pressed closer together and stepped back from the rail.

<!-- BEAT 4: The moment before contact -->

The ship was forty meters from the beach. Thirty. The drive had throttled to almost nothing — the hull moved on momentum and current now, nosing toward the shallows with the slow certainty of something that knew exactly where it was going. The water here was different from Antarctic water. Warmer, darker, full of sediment and life. Moss could see fish scattering beneath the hull. He could smell the harbor — wood and pitch and fish guts and smoke and the deep mineral funk of tidal flats at low water. The smell of every morning he had ever woken up in Tidemouth.

The weapons came up as the ship approached. Crossbows leveled. The polearms angled forward. A woman near the left flank — Moss did not recognize her — drew back a bowstring and sighted along the shaft. The arrowhead was iron. Hand-forged. The kind that bent on impact but went deep.

Moss looked at the line of armed scholars and fishers and dockworkers and saw what they saw: a ship of impossible material gliding toward their harbor, carrying pale strangers in strange clothes, driven by no wind and no oar. The last ship to approach from the south had been one of the twelve that Moss had sailed on, wooden, crewed by their own people, flying flags they recognized. That was seventeen months ago. Eleven of those twelve ships had not come back. A hundred and fifty-seven people had not come back.

And now this.

He understood their fear the way he understood the sea — not intellectually but physically, in the body, because it was the same fear he had carried when he first stood in Habitat Prithvi's corridor and felt the hum of something vast and alien running through the walls. The fear of the unknown wearing a shape that was almost familiar but not familiar enough. Almost human. But different.

The ship was ten meters out. Five. The hull would touch the sand in seconds.

Moss climbed onto the railing. Sūrya said something behind him — a warning, his name — but he was already up, one foot on the rail, one hand on the forestay cable, his body finding the balance without thinking because some things the modification had not taken. He was still a sailor. The sea still knew him.

He opened his mouth and the creole came out rough and loud and wrong. The accent had shifted. The vowels were flatter, the consonants harder, shaped by months of pidgin and Satya. It was his language spoken by a man who had been away too long, the words correct and the music off, like a familiar song played in a different key.

"Don't shoot. They're human. We're all human."

His voice carried across the water. It hit the shore and he heard it come back to him — the harbor acoustics, the same acoustics that had carried his mother's voice when she called him in from the docks as a child. The same stone walls, the same water, the same air. Only the voice had changed.

Kael's hand moved. A single downward motion — sharp, decisive, the gesture of a woman who had spent two years leading a coalition of people who argued about everything and agreed about nothing. The crossbows lowered. The polearms dropped to vertical. The woman with the iron-tipped arrow eased her draw.

The hull touched sand. The sound was wrong — Antarctic alloy on Continental beach, a hiss instead of the wooden groan Moss had heard a thousand times. The ship settled. The shallow water lapped at the hull's flanks and the warm wind came off the land and brought with it the smell of cookfires and turned soil and everything Moss had carried in his body for fourteen months in the ice.

Nobody moved.

The twelve Antarctikans stood behind him in their pale clothes, wide-eyed, breathing fast, their hands empty, their meshes silent, their bodies in a world that had no architecture to manage them. Sūrya's jaw was set. Dhara had stopped shaking and was staring at the shore with an expression that Moss recognized because he had worn it himself, in another place, facing another unknown: the look of a person who had understood the word *different* all their life and was now, for the first time, standing inside its meaning.

On the shore, Kael stood with her hand still half-raised, her dark eyes on Moss, and Moss saw Old Sekani behind her — the keeper, sixty-eight, his white hair bright against the crowd, his face turned upward with an expression that was not surprise and not fear but something older and quieter. The old man who had listened to the sky all his life was watching the sky's answer climb off a railing and stand on the prow of a ship that should not exist.

Moss looked at Kael. She looked at him. The distance was ten meters. Close enough to see the scar on her arm. Close enough to see that she had new lines around her eyes. Two years of running a coalition after Renna's death. Two years of keeping the observatory alive and the signal watch going and the fractious, stubborn, brilliant people of Tidemouth pointed in the same direction long enough to matter.

She looked older. She looked the same. Both true, the way warm bread and cold bread were both true.

He stepped off the railing and dropped to the deck. Walked to the gangway. The ship had deployed it — Antarctic automation, the ramp extending without anyone touching anything, the hull reading its own position relative to the waterline and calculating the angle. Moss walked down the ramp and his boots hit wet sand and the sand was warm under the soles.

Eleven steps. He counted them. Eleven steps from the gangway to the dry beach. In Antarctica, at the ice shelf, he had managed eleven steps past the airlock before collapsing. He remembered it in his body — the cold, the thin air, the moment his legs failed. That had been arrival at the end of the world. This was arrival at the beginning of it. Same number of steps. Different direction.

He stopped at the waterline. Behind him, the ship. Twelve strangers from inside the ice. Five hundred years of silence.

In front of him, the shore. His people. Armed. Afraid. Waiting.

Between them, a man who was neither. A man with amber-streaked eyes in a face that was too light for this coast and too dark for that ice. A man who spoke two languages badly and a third that was dying. A man who carried everything with him because someone had to.

He stood in the warm sand and he waited, and Kael walked forward, and the five hundred years ended in the space between two people who had once known each other and would have to learn again.

<!-- CONTINUITY NOTES:
- Timeline: Month 25 — approximately 3 months after departure from Antarctica (Month 22, per Ch 31)
- Moss's physical state: amber-streaked eyes, wider pupils, lighter skin, leaner frame, thinned calluses, faster metabolism — all consistent with Ch 22/23 modification details
- Moss's language: creole degraded after 14+ months of pidgin/Satya; accent shifted, vowels flatter, consonants harder; still functional but effortful
- Ship: Antarctic-engineered, corrosion-resistant alloy hull (silver-pale blue), thermal differential drive (ocean temperature gradients), automated gangway deployment, mast for redundancy; no Continental-compatible transmitter
- Delegation: 12 Antarctikans + Moss = 13 total on ship
- Sūrya: delegation leader, at prow with Moss during approach; trained for contact but not for weapons; reaching for mesh that isn't there (out of VEDA range 3 months)
- Dhara: youngest delegate, 22, data systems specialist, volunteered to see unmediated sky; shaking during approach, then stilled — parallel to Moss's own first-contact reaction
- Kael: ~29, tall, burn scar left forearm, close-cropped hair, sleeves pushed up; leading coalition after Renna's death (natural causes, narrative gap); new lines around eyes; no weapon, directing militia with hand signals
- Old Sekani: 68, white hair, keeper of oral histories, present at waterfront, expression of recognition not surprise — "sky voices" believer vindicated
- Renna: confirmed dead (natural causes, narrative gap between Arcs 3 and 7), Kael has led coalition ~2 years
- Continental weapons: improvised polearms, crossbows, old projectile weapons (lead shot, black powder); militia-level, not military
- Signal went dark Month 22 when delegation left VEDA's range; 3 months of silence before ship appeared
- Observatory: still maintained by Kael, on hill above harbor, concrete/rust ruins
- Tidemouth: Caribbean/Atlantic coast, ~8,000 people, wood/stone/salvaged metal construction, harbor, old towers
- 11 steps from gangway to beach — deliberate parallel to Ch 16 (11 steps past airlock before collapse at ice shelf)
- "Warm bread and cold bread" — callback to Ch 23 bread memory (remembered warm, probably cold, both true)
- "Someone had to" — Moss's recurring phrase, used internally
- Key line: "Don't shoot! They're human! We're all human!" — first Continental words Moss has spoken in months; accent shifted
- No VEDA presence — ship is out of range; Antarctikans are unmediated for first time in their lives
- Kael recognizes Moss and does not recognize him — central tension of the homecoming
- Chapter ends at the moment of contact, not after — the meeting itself is deferred to Ch 35
- Promise to reader: What happens when Kael reaches Moss? How do the Antarctikans react to an unoptimized world? How does Tidemouth react to proof that the ice people are real? What does Old Sekani say?
