<!-- BEAT 1: Sūrya learns of the expedition -->

The message arrived in fragments, as all messages did.

Twenty-three characters per minute. Each one a pulse at 23.4 kHz, shaped by a woman fourteen thousand kilometers away whose hands Sūrya had never touched. Kael's transmissions had a rhythm now — a cadence Sūrya had learned to read the way a musician reads tempo. Fast bursts for numbers. Longer pauses between conceptual blocks. A particular stutter before emotional content, as though the sender had to decide how much feeling could survive compression into mathematics.

This transmission was all stutter.

Sūrya decoded it at 03:14 station time, alone in the VLF control room. Dhruv had gone to rest at 02:00. Lakshya's delay window on the monitoring logs would hold for another four hours. The corridor outside was silent, the habitat's fifty thousand residents deep in their VEDA-calibrated sleep, and Sūrya sat in the blue-white glow of the receiver display and translated numbers into words and words into a thing she did not want to understand.

Twelve ships. One hundred eighty crew. Departure in five weeks.

They were going to sail across the Crossing.

She read the decoded text three times. Kael had used their established notation for quantity, time, direction. The message was precise. Twelve vessels. Southern heading. Crew count by vessel. Estimated departure window. No ambiguity. No room for misinterpretation.

Sūrya pressed her thumb against her left ear and held it there.

She had known this was possible. The body diagrams, the DNA exchange, the slow accumulation of shared understanding — all of it pointed toward a physical meeting. Someone would have to cross. She had said it herself, in the laboratory, months ago: *when*, not *if*. But she had imagined diplomacy. Preparation. A coordinated effort between two civilizations that had learned enough about each other to make the crossing together.

Not this. Not twelve ships hurled into an ocean that would try to dissolve them.

She queried VEDA.

The response came through her mesh in the flat, efficient cadence of the deep archive layer — the oldest part of VEDA, the part that held the environmental models and the atmospheric simulations and the five centuries of oceanographic data that nobody on the Council ever requested because the data described a world outside the habitat, and the world outside the habitat was not something Antarctic civilization preferred to think about.

Survival probability per vessel, given current H₂S venting models and storm corridor data: 8 to 12 percent.

Sūrya stared at the number. She did the arithmetic. Twelve ships at 10 percent survival each. The probability that at least one survived: 72 percent. The expected number of survivors: 18 out of 180.

One hundred and sixty-two people would die.

She stood up from the console. Sat down. Stood up again. Her body could not decide what to do with the information, so it oscillated. She pressed both palms flat against the console surface and felt the hum of the transmitter array through the metal — the same hum that connected her to Kael, to the signal, to the other half of humanity that was about to throw itself into a poisoned ocean because no one on this side would help.

The Council had granted tacit tolerance for monitoring. Not intervention. Monitoring. They could listen. They could decode. They could log and file and categorize. They could not act.

One hundred and sixty-two people.

Sūrya sat down and did not move for eleven minutes. The mesh registered her vitals: heart rate elevated, cortisol spiking, galvanic response consistent with acute distress. It offered calming protocols. She declined.

<!-- BEAT 2: The navigation data -->

VEDA's environmental models were comprehensive.

This was the terrible thing. Five hundred years of continuous monitoring — atmospheric sensors, seismic arrays, the VLF system itself bouncing signals off the ionosphere and measuring the returns. VEDA had mapped the ocean it could not see with the indirect precision of a blind cartographer. Current patterns derived from thermal models. H₂S venting zones predicted from tectonic and bacterial activity data. Storm corridors calculated from atmospheric pressure differentials and Coriolis modeling.

The data was imperfect. VEDA stated this clearly in every query response, appending confidence intervals and error margins with the fastidiousness of a system that had been designed never to overstate its certainty. No satellites. No surface observations. No ship reports. The models were theoretical, built on physics and chemistry and five centuries of atmospheric data, extrapolated downward to an ocean surface that no Antarctic instrument had directly measured since the sealing.

But they were better than nothing. They were better than sailing blind.

Sūrya pulled the data. Her access as a junior scientific advisor permitted queries to the deep archive. She had pulled environmental models before — for the signal analysis, for the body diagram exchange, for the atmospheric propagation calculations that kept the VLF link functional. This query was different only in intent.

The ocean resolved on her display in false color. Blue for survivable corridors. Yellow for intermittent risk. Red for kill zones — regions where H₂S concentrations exceeded 100 parts per million with greater than 60 percent probability in any given week. The red zones shifted with the models' temporal axis. They were not static barriers. They breathed, expanded, contracted, following patterns that VEDA could predict with moderate confidence for windows of two to three weeks.

Storm corridors overlaid in white. Sustained wave heights of 15 to 25 meters. The corridors migrated seasonally, and the current month — month six — was the narrow window between the austral winter storms and the sulfide bloom season. A window that the Continentals, lacking this data, could not know about.

Sūrya mapped the optimal route.

It was not a single line. It was a series of waypoints — coordinates where the probability of both H₂S exposure and storm encounter dropped below 20 percent simultaneously. Twenty-three waypoints, threading between kill zones like a path through a minefield that rearranged itself every week. Each waypoint had a temporal validity: *safe before day X, unsafe after day Y*. The window for each was narrow. Some as little as four days.

She stared at the map. Twenty-three points of light in an ocean of red and yellow. A path that could save lives. A path that existed in VEDA's archive and nowhere else on Earth.

Transmitting it would not be monitoring.

Transmitting it would be intervention. Direct, unilateral, unauthorized intervention in the actions of an external civilization. It would make the first transmission — the primes, the handshake, the two hours of mathematics in the dark — look like a minor infraction. The first act had been communication. This would be navigation. She would be steering Continental ships through an ocean she had never seen, using data from a system the Council had not authorized her to share.

She touched her left ear. The gesture had become involuntary — a tic, a tell. Dhruv had noticed it weeks ago. He had not mentioned it. He was 112 years old and understood that some things did not require commentary.

If the Council discovered this, there was no precedent for the consequence. *Adharma* of this magnitude had never occurred. The system had no category for it, no protocol, no remediation pathway. She would be the first, and the system would have to invent a response.

She pulled up the waypoint data and began encoding it.

<!-- BEAT 3: The transmission -->

It took nine nights.

The bandwidth was the constraint. At 23.4 kHz through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, with their established encoding protocol, Sūrya could transmit roughly twenty data points per session before the noise floor degraded the signal beyond reliable decoding. Twenty data points: a coordinate pair, a temporal window, a hazard classification. One waypoint per session, with margin for error correction and confirmation.

She worked alone. Dhruv knew — she had told him before the first session, standing in his quarters beneath the photograph of his grandmother and the open sky. He had listened. He had closed his eyes. He had said: "The woman in that photograph would have done the same." He did not offer to help with the transmissions. He did not need to. His role was the same as before: to be the person who knew, so that if Sūrya was discovered, the act would not die with her. Someone would remember why.

Lakshya extended the log delay to its maximum: six hours per session. She did not ask what Sūrya was transmitting. She said only: "I will need to know eventually. But not tonight."

Night one. Sūrya transmitted the protocol header: a new message type, distinct from the mathematical and image exchanges. She defined coordinate encoding — latitude and longitude in their shared numerical system. She defined temporal encoding — days from a shared epoch they had established months earlier. She defined hazard classifications: three levels, mapped to the three colors on her display.

Kael's response came in fourteen minutes. Confirmation. Understanding. And a single repeated symbol that Sūrya had learned to interpret as a question: *Why?*

Sūrya transmitted: the number 180. Then the symbol for *danger*. Then the coordinate for Kael's location — the northern source point they had triangulated months ago. Then the coordinate for Prithvi. Then, between them, the hazard classification for *lethal*.

A pause. Longer than propagation delay. Kael processing.

Then: confirmation. The exchange continued.

Night two through five. Waypoints one through nine. Each session followed the same structure: Sūrya transmitted a coordinate pair, a temporal window, and a hazard code. Kael confirmed receipt and — on several occasions — requested retransmission of values that had been corrupted by ionospheric noise. The error rate was higher than their mathematical exchanges. Numbers with decimal precision were harder to verify than integers. Sūrya added redundancy, transmitting each coordinate three times. The bandwidth cost was brutal. She could manage two waypoints per night instead of the three she had planned.

She did not know if Kael could translate the coordinate system into something the Continental navigators would understand. She did not know if the Continentals had charts precise enough to locate the waypoints. She did not know if their ships could reach the safe corridors in the temporal windows she specified. She did not know if VEDA's models were accurate enough to matter.

She sent the data anyway.

Night six. Waypoint thirteen. The H₂S venting zone south of the mid-Atlantic ridge, where the probability exceeded 300 parts per million for six days out of every fourteen. She encoded it as a simple instruction: *Avoid these coordinates. Days 15 through 21 of transit, lethal concentration.* The encoding was clumsy — their shared language had not been designed for imperative statements. She had to construct the grammar of warning from the building blocks of mathematics and logic. *If vessel at coordinates X,Y during interval T1-T2, then probability of H₂S greater than 300 ppm equals 0.73. 300 ppm equals death.*

She hoped the word for death translated.

Night seven. Storm corridors. Wave height data was harder to encode than chemical concentrations — the concept of wave periodicity required a notational framework they had not established. Sūrya spent forty minutes of the session defining terms before she could transmit a single data point. She described sustained wave heights in meters, using their shared unit system. She described duration in hours. She transmitted three storm corridor boundaries and their seasonal migration vectors.

Night eight. Current maps. The south Atlantic gyre, the circumpolar current, the coastal deflection patterns that could add or subtract weeks from a crossing depending on route selection. She encoded current direction as vector angles and current speed as meters per second. The precision was low — VEDA's models gave velocity estimates with error margins of plus or minus 40 percent. She transmitted the error margins. Honesty mattered more than reassurance.

Night nine. The final waypoints. Nineteen through twenty-three. The approach to the Antarctic coast — the last thousand kilometers, where the water temperature dropped and the H₂S concentrations diminished but the storm intensity increased. The models showed a corridor between 58 and 62 degrees south where the probability of survivable conditions peaked at 67 percent during a window of eleven days in month eight.

She transmitted the last coordinate at 04:47 station time. Powered down the transmitter. Sat in the dark.

The control room hummed. The same hum as every night. The same frequency, the same amplitude. Outside, the habitat slept. VEDA monitored. The recyclers cycled.

Sūrya had just transmitted classified environmental data to a foreign civilization without authorization. She had provided navigational guidance for a military-scale expedition that the Council did not know about and had not sanctioned. She had used VEDA's own models — the deep archive, the five-century dataset, the computational resources of the system she had been raised to trust — against the explicit wishes of the governing body that administered it.

She had committed *adharma* so far beyond the first infraction that the word itself felt inadequate. The first time, she had opened a door. This time, she had walked through it and set fire to the building behind her.

<!-- BEAT 4: The weight of choice -->

The corridor home was 340 meters long. Sūrya walked it slowly.

The lights were at 4 percent — night cycle minimum. The walls were the same pale composite they had always been. The air was 21 percent oxygen, 0.04 percent CO₂, temperature 19.2 degrees Celsius. Everything calibrated. Everything maintained. Everything exactly as VEDA had determined was optimal for human well-being in a sealed subterranean habitat on a continent that no longer supported life on its surface.

Her footsteps were the only sound. Each one precise, deliberate. She had always walked this way — with what Dhruv called her "intentional economy," as though each step were a decision rather than a reflex. Tonight the precision felt different. Not habitual. Necessary. As though she needed the discipline of controlled movement to keep the rest of her from flying apart.

She had done the arithmetic again during the last transmission. Twenty-three waypoints. If the Continental navigators could decode them, could plot them on whatever charts they possessed, could steer their ships through the corridors she had mapped — the survival probability per vessel rose from 8-12 percent to somewhere between 30 and 45 percent. VEDA's estimate, when she had run the simulation with waypoint-guided routing, had returned the numbers without commentary. The system did not editorialize. It did not say: *You have just tripled their odds of survival.* It said: *Probability of vessel survival given optimal routing through low-hazard corridors: 0.31 to 0.47, confidence interval 0.68.*

The difference between 10 percent and 40 percent was not a number. It was people. It was the gap between eighteen survivors and seventy. Between twelve ships lost and seven ships through. Between a catastrophe and a chance.

Sūrya stopped at the junction where the residential corridor met the central atrium. The atrium was dark. The bioluminescent panels along the ceiling had dimmed to their lowest setting — a faint blue-green glow that the designers, five centuries ago, had calibrated to mimic starlight. It did not look like starlight. Sūrya had never seen starlight, but she knew — from Dhruv's photographs, from the archive images, from the deep certainty of a body that remembered skies it had never stood under — that this was a poor imitation. A system's best guess at something it had never experienced.

She thought about the 180 people preparing to board twelve ships in a harbor she had never seen, in a city she could not imagine, under a sky she had only observed in crude 128-by-128-pixel images transmitted one agonizing line at a time. She did not know their names. She did not know their faces. She knew only that they had volunteered to cross an ocean that would try to kill them, and that one of them — the man Kael had mentioned in an early exchange, the sailor, the one who had been south before — had signed on as first mate to the lead vessel.

Moss. His name was Moss. She had no image of him. She had a name and a function and the knowledge that he was walking toward her across fourteen thousand kilometers of poisoned water.

If the data worked — if Kael could translate it, if the navigators could use it, if VEDA's models held — some of them would live. Moss might live. The ships might thread the corridors she had mapped, dodge the kill belts she had flagged, ride the currents she had charted. They might reach the Antarctic coast. They might stand on ice and look up at a sky that was real, not simulated, and breathe air that was not recycled, and meet the other half of their species for the first time in five hundred years.

Or the data might be wrong. The models might be inaccurate. The coordinates might be garbled. The Continentals might not be able to decode her format. And 180 people might sail into the Crossing with false confidence and die in corridors she had told them were safe.

Sūrya reached her quarters. The door recognized her biometrics and opened. Inside: the sleep surface, the workstation, the narrow shelf of physical objects she kept as a private indulgence — a smooth stone from the habitat's geological collection, a printed copy of the first prime sequence she had decoded from the northern signal, a strand of her own hair sealed in resin, dark as the space between stars.

She did not turn on the light. She stood in the doorway and pressed her thumb to her left ear and held it there until the pressure became pain and the pain became something she could use to stay present.

She had chosen sides. There was no undoing it. The transmissions were logged — Lakshya's delay would expire in two hours, and the records would enter VEDA's archive with her access codes attached. The deep archive layer would flag the anomaly. The civic coordination layer might or might not escalate it to the Council, depending on how the pattern-matching algorithms classified unauthorized environmental data transmission to an external receiver. There was no precedent. The algorithms had no training data for treason.

*Treason.* The word did not exist in Satya. The closest approximation was *adharma-vipula* — a violation so large it exceeded the system's capacity to categorize. A function that did not return unexpected values but rejected the premise of the calculation entirely.

She stepped inside. The door closed. The darkness was total.

One hundred and eighty people on twelve ships. Some of them would die no matter what she did. Some of them might live because of what she did. She could not know. She could not control the outcome. She could only control the act, and the act was done, and she would do it again. She knew this with the same certainty she knew her own name. Given the same information, the same odds, the same 340-meter corridor home in the dark — she would sit at that console and transmit those coordinates every time. Not because it was optimal. Not because VEDA's models guaranteed success. Because 180 people were sailing south, and she had the map, and silence was a choice she could no longer make.

She lay down on the sleep surface. The mesh registered her vitals: heart rate declining, cortisol normalizing, respiration approaching resting pattern. It classified her state as *approaching sleep*. It was wrong. She was not approaching sleep. She was lying in the dark, staring at a ceiling she could not see, thinking about an ocean she had never touched, holding in her mind the twenty-three points of light she had sent north — twenty-three coordinates, twenty-three chances, twenty-three small acts of defiance encoded in mathematics and launched into the waveguide at the speed of light.

A butterfly, she thought. The old concept from the deep archive — chaos theory, sensitive dependence on initial conditions. A butterfly beats its wings and the storm changes course. A woman transmits twenty-three coordinates and the ocean becomes survivable.

Or does not.

She closed her eyes. The habitat hummed. Fifty thousand people slept. And fourteen thousand kilometers to the north, in a harbor she would never see, twelve ships were being built by hands she would never hold, to carry people she would never meet across water she had just tried to make less lethal, because a woman who had been raised to trust the system had decided, for the second time in her life, that the system was wrong.

The mesh offered a dream protocol. She declined.

She did not need VEDA to tell her what to dream about.
