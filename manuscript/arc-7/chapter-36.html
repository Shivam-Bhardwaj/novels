    <p>He stepped off the gangway and the sand took his weight differently than it should have.</p>
    <p>Kael saw it in his stride. Moss had always walked like a man fighting the ground for traction — heavy heel-strikes, wide stance, the rolling gait of someone who had learned to balance on decks before he learned to balance on dirt. Now he walked like he was apologizing to the surface beneath him. Light steps, almost tentative, his weight centered and distributed with a precision that was not Moss. Not the Moss she had mapped in her mind over years of watching him cross this same stretch of beach.</p>
    <p>He came toward her. Eleven steps. She counted without deciding to. Glass counting — the old habit, measuring distance the way she measured the gap between a lens and its focal point, the precise interval where clarity lived. Eleven steps and she could see his face.</p>
    <p>It was his face.</p>
    <p>It was not his face.</p>
    <p>The nose — broken twice, set badly both times, the bridge pushed a quarter-inch to the left — was the same. The shoulders were his, broad enough to fill a doorway, though something had narrowed them, drawn the muscle closer to the bone. His hands were a sailor's hands: wide palms, thick knuckles, the geometry of a man who had gripped rope since childhood. But the calluses were wrong. Thinned. The skin was wrong. Lighter by two shades, as if someone had soaked him in something that leached the color. And his eyes — dark brown, still dark brown, but with amber running through the irises in streaks that caught the afternoon light like flaws in blown glass. Inclusions. Something introduced during the making that had not been there before.</p>
    <p>He stopped two paces from her. Close enough that she could smell him — salt, yes, the old salt smell, but under it something clinical, something clean in a way that Continental bodies were not clean, as if his skin had been scrubbed at a level she could not see.</p>
    <p>"Moss," she said. Testing the name against the man. Seeing if it fit.</p>
    <p>"Kael."</p>
    <p>His voice. Deeper than she remembered, or maybe the same depth with different resonance, the vowels flattened, the consonants carrying edges they had not carried before. He spoke her name the way a person spoke a word they had not used in a long time — carefully, as if the sounds might have shifted meaning while he was gone.</p>
    <p>"What happened to you," she said. Not a question. An observation. The way she said it when a lens came out of the furnace wrong — not asking why, just noting the fact of the distortion.</p>
    <p>He looked at her. The amber-streaked eyes held steady. Sailor's eyes. That had not changed. He could still hold a gaze the way he held a heading — fixed, deliberate, patient.</p>
    <p>"I learned a different way to be the same thing," he said.</p>
    <p>She did not understand. She filed it. She would.</p>
    <p>Movement on the ship. Kael looked past Moss to the gangway and saw them coming.</p>
    <p>The first was a woman. Short — a full head shorter than Kael, maybe 160 centimeters. Pale in a way Kael had never seen on a living person, skin the color of beach sand after rain, as if sunlight were something that had happened to her ancestors but not to her. Long dark hair pulled back and fastened with something metallic. Gray eyes. Not blue-gray or green-gray but gray, true gray, the color of certain kinds of ash. The pupils were wide, wider than they should have been in this light, adjusted for dimness, drinking in the brightness of the Continental afternoon with an intensity that looked almost painful.</p>
    <p>She stepped onto the gangway and her foot met the ramp's surface with the controlled placement of someone who calculated each step. No wasted motion. No swing of the arms for balance. She moved the way a glass rod moved through a flame — smoothly, deliberately, every angle considered. Kael recognized the quality. She had seen it in masters of a craft, people whose bodies had been trained to a single set of precise movements until the precision was indistinguishable from instinct.</p>
    <p>Then the woman reached the sand.</p>
    <p>Her right foot sank. Not far — an inch, maybe less — but Kael saw the reaction travel through her body like a shock. The woman's left hand shot out, fingers spread, reaching for a wall that was not there. Her balance stuttered. She did not fall. She caught herself with a correction so fast it was almost invisible, weight shifting, knees bending, her center dropping low. But for a fraction of a second, the controlled precision had cracked, and what showed through the crack was a person standing on a surface that did not behave the way any surface she had ever known behaved.</p>
    <p>Sand shifted. Sand was not a floor. Sand did not hold.</p>
    <p>The woman squinted. Her wide pupils contracted and her face tightened and she raised one hand — not to shade her eyes but palm-out, fingers together, as if she could measure the light with her skin. The sun was overhead and unfiltered and Kael could see it hitting the woman like a physical thing, pressing against her face, her pale arms, the silver-gray fabric of her clothing that caught the light and redirected it in ways that Continental cloth did not.</p>
    <p>Behind her, more of them. Two, three, five, ten, twelve total. All pale. All moving with that same careful economy, as if the air itself were a substance they had to negotiate. They came down the gangway in a close line, and each one of them reached the sand and had the same moment — the ground giving way, the brief recalculation, the body adjusting to a surface that was not engineered. One of them, a young woman near the back, stopped at the bottom of the ramp and stood with her face turned upward and her eyes closed and her mouth open, and Kael realized she was tasting the air. Breathing it in without filtration, without processing, without whatever systems these people used to manage the simple act of filling their lungs. Raw air. Sea air. The air that Kael had breathed every day of her life, ordinary as dirt, and this woman was standing in it like it was a revelation.</p>
    <p>They gathered on the beach in a tight cluster. Twelve of them. Their clothes shifted color in the sun — silver, pale blue, silver again — and they stood close together the way animals stood together in open ground, seeking the safety of proximity because the space around them was too large, too uncontrolled, too full of variables their training had not covered.</p>
    <p>The armed line behind Kael tightened. She heard boots shifting in sand, the creak of crossbow stocks, the particular silence of people trying to decide whether to be afraid.</p>
    <p>She kept her hand raised. Hold position. The signal had not changed.</p>
    <p>The woman with gray eyes walked forward. She left the cluster of her people and crossed the sand toward Kael with steps that were still careful, still measured against the uncertain surface, but steady now. Committed. She stopped five paces away and stood straight and looked at Kael with an expression that was so composed it took Kael a moment to see the effort holding it in place. The muscles around the woman's jaw were tight. Her hands were clasped in front of her sternum, fingers interlocked, and Kael could see the tendons standing out across her knuckles.</p>
    <p>The woman spoke.</p>
    <p>The language was nothing Kael had heard. Not the old tongues, not the trade pidgins of the coastal settlements, not the fragments of pre-Sundering speech that Old Sekani kept in his memory and recited on solstice nights. This was precise. Architectural. Each sound placed with the same economy the woman used in her movements — no excess, no filler, every syllable carrying information. The consonants were soft, the vowels open, and the rhythm was even, metered, as if the language itself had been designed to minimize ambiguity.</p>
    <p>It was beautiful the way a lens was beautiful — not because it was decorated but because its shape was exactly suited to its function.</p>
    <p>Kael understood nothing.</p>
    <p>The woman paused. Something moved behind her gray eyes — a recalculation, Kael thought, a shift from one mode to another, from the language she thought in to the language she had built for this moment. When she spoke again, the sounds were different. Rougher. Simpler. A vocabulary assembled from parts — Continental roots mixed with sounds Kael did not recognize, the grammar stripped to its frame, meaning conveyed through blunt placement rather than the architecture she had used before.</p>
    <p>Kael caught fragments. <em>Come</em>. <em>Give</em>. Something that might have been <em>people</em> or <em>kin</em> or <em>family</em> — a word with a Continental root stretched into a shape she could almost recognize, the way a reflection in moving water was almost the thing it reflected.</p>
    <p>She looked at Moss.</p>
    <p>"She says," Moss said, and his creole was slow, effortful, the accent still wrong, as if the words were coming from a place deeper in his throat than they used to. "We come not to take. We come to give and receive. We are — " He stopped. His mouth worked around something. "Kin. Long-separated kin."</p>
    <p>Kael looked at the woman. The woman looked at Kael. Between them, the translation sat like a piece of glass that had been ground to the wrong curvature — it transmitted the light, but the image it produced was distorted. Off-focus. Kael could see the shape of what the woman had said, could feel its outline, but the detail was lost. The precision of the first language, the careful construction of the pidgin, the rough conversion into Moss's damaged creole — each step had stripped away a layer of meaning, and what reached Kael was the residue. The intention without the architecture. The direction without the distance.</p>
    <p>She thought: this is what it will be like. Every conversation. Every exchange. This gap between what is meant and what is received. The refraction.</p>
    <p>She had spent her life working with refraction. She knew what it did to light. She knew that the image on the other side of the lens was always inverted, always shifted, always changed by the medium it passed through. And she knew that the distortion was not an error. It was information. It told you the properties of the glass.</p>
    <p>"Show me," Kael said. To the woman, though the woman would not understand. To Moss. To the space between them. Show me who you are, and I will learn the shape of the glass between us, and I will learn to read the image it produces.</p>
    <p>Moss translated. The woman with gray eyes listened, and something in her face changed — not a smile, nothing so broad, but a micro-adjustment in the set of her mouth and the angle of her brows that suggested a meaning had arrived. Imperfect. Partial. But arrived.</p>
    <p>Behind them, on the beach, Old Sekani was weeping.</p>
    <p>Kael did not turn around. She did not need to. She could hear him — the ragged breathing, the wet inhale, the sound a man made when something he had believed his entire life, something he had been mocked for and argued against and held to with the stubbornness of a barnacle on a rock, turned out to be true. The sky-voices were people. The signals were real. The ice held a civilization, and it had sent twelve of its own to stand on this beach in the warm light and speak words that no Continental could parse.</p>
    <p>Sixty-eight years old. He had waited sixty-eight years for this.</p>
    <p>Kael let him weep. She kept her eyes on the woman in front of her.</p>
    <p>The crossbows did not lower.</p>
    <p>Kael had given the signal to hold, not to stand down. There was a difference. Hold meant: do not fire. It did not mean: trust them. Renna would have understood the difference without being told, would have managed the militia's fear with the political instinct that Kael had never developed and now missed the way she missed a tool that had been in her hand so long she had forgotten it was a tool and not a part of her body.</p>
    <p>Renna was dead. Eighteen months now. The coughing sickness that came in the wet season and took the old and the weak and the unlucky. Renna had been none of those things — she had been fifty-four, and strong, and the luckiest politician Kael had ever known — but the sickness did not read the odds. Renna had died in her own bed with her boots on because she refused to take them off, and the coalition she had built had frayed at the seams within a month, and Kael had spent every day since then holding it together with will and argument and the blunt authority of being the person who kept the observatory running, who could read the signals, who said <em>they are coming</em> when everyone else said <em>they are not real</em>.</p>
    <p>Now they were here. And Kael was standing on a beach with a militia she only half-controlled and a delegation she could not speak to and a man she had known all her life who was no longer the man she had known.</p>
    <p>She turned to the militia line. Faces she recognized. Tomás, who ran the metalworks. His crossbow was up, his jaw set, his eyes fixed on the pale strangers with the flat hostility of a man who had lost a brother on the southern expedition and blamed the ice for taking him. Wen, who taught the children, holding a polearm with hands that were better suited to chalk and paper. Lila, the bowyer, the one who had drawn on the ship during approach — her arrow was nocked but pointed down, her expression not hostile but watchful, the face of a craftswoman evaluating unfamiliar material.</p>
    <p>They were afraid. Kael could see it the way she could see a flaw in glass — not by looking at it directly but by watching what it did to the light around it. The fear bent their postures, narrowed their stances, tightened their grips. These were not soldiers. They were people. Scholars, crafters, fishers, dockworkers — the same people who argued about water rights at town meetings and traded gossip at the harbor market and sang too loud in the taverns on seventh-night. They had weapons because the world was not safe and never had been, not because they knew what to do with them against twelve pale strangers who stood on the beach with empty hands and enormous eyes.</p>
    <p>"We walk," Kael said. Loud enough for the line to hear. "I take them to the council hall. Escort formation. Weapons at rest. Anyone draws without my signal, they answer to me."</p>
    <p>Tomás opened his mouth. Kael looked at him. He closed it.</p>
    <p>She turned back to Moss. "Tell her we are going into the city. Tell her my people will be armed. Tell her — " She stopped. Considered. The glass metaphor was there, the one she always reached for: the clearest lens is the one ground with the most patience. She discarded it. The woman would not understand it even through two translations. "Tell her she is a guest. That means something here. Tell her that."</p>
    <p>Moss spoke to the woman. The pidgin — Kael heard it now, could almost separate it from the creole, the way she could separate two overlapping sounds if she listened at the right angle. A rougher music. A built language, assembled from parts that did not originally fit, forced into a shape that could carry meaning across the gap.</p>
    <p>The woman with gray eyes listened. She responded. Three words in the pidgin, and Kael did not understand them, but she heard the tone — open, formal, careful. The tone of a person accepting something they knew was fragile.</p>
    <p>Moss said: "She says: we walk with you."</p>
    <p>Kael turned and began to move toward the city. She walked fast — she always walked fast, it was the only speed she trusted, the speed at which the world had to keep up with her or get out of her way. Then she slowed. She slowed because the woman behind her was walking on sand for the first time, on ground that shifted and gave and required a constant negotiation with gravity that no sealed floor had ever demanded. She slowed because the twelve strangers from the ice were squinting in the light and flinching at the sound of gulls and stepping around tidal pools as if the water in them might be hostile.</p>
    <p>She slowed because the distance between two civilizations could not be crossed at her pace. It would be crossed at theirs. Or it would not be crossed at all.</p>
    <p>The militia fell into escort formation. Four ahead, four behind, the rest on the flanks. Weapons at rest — crossbows uncocked, polearms vertical, arrows in quivers. Not lowered. Not raised. The intermediate state. The grammar of a threat held in reserve.</p>
    <p>They walked up the beach toward the warehouse row and the streets beyond. Kael in front. The woman with gray eyes behind her, stepping with increasing confidence on the shifting ground, her wide pupils slowly contracting as her eyes negotiated with the sun. Moss between them, translating nothing because no one was speaking, his amber-streaked eyes moving between the two worlds he had been stitched into like a seam between two pieces of glass — visible, structural, and under stress.</p>
    <p>Behind them, Old Sekani walked with his face wet and his hands open and his mouth moving around words that were not for anyone present. He was speaking to the dead. To the keepers before him who had listened and believed and been called fools. He was telling them: you were right. The sky had a voice and the voice had a body and the body was walking up the beach in silver clothes with gray eyes full of too much light.</p>
    <p>The city rose ahead of them. Wood and stone and salvaged metal. Smoke from cookfires. Faces in windows. The ordinary, unoptimized, unmanaged mess of eight thousand people living without a system, and somewhere in that mess, a council hall where the next words would be spoken and mistranslated and spoken again, and the slow, imprecise, distorted work of understanding would begin.</p>
    <p>Kael walked toward it. The strangers followed. The sand recorded every footprint — Continental boots and Antarctic soles, side by side, the first marks of a shared path pressed into ground that would hold them until the tide came in and took them away.</p>
    <p>But the path would remain. Paths did. Even after the marks were gone.</p>
