    <p>The table was wrong for diplomacy.</p>
    <p>Kael had built it from reclaimed wharf timber — nine planks, uneven, still carrying the grain of salt exposure and the faint smell of tar. It seated fourteen if nobody minded elbows touching. The delegation minded. He could see it in the way they arranged themselves: precise intervals, each Antartikan equidistant from the next, a geometry of personal space so exact it could have been plotted on a grid.</p>
    <p>He served them food that had no grid.</p>
    <p>Grilled mackerel, skin still cracked from the flame, the flesh flaking in uneven layers where the heat had found the fat. Root vegetables — parsnips, beets, carrots — roasted until the sugars darkened and the edges blackened in places and the whole mess of them sat on the platter looking like something dug from the earth, which they were. Salt bread, dense, the crust fractured in the tearing. Fermented cloudberry drink, sharp and sweet and faintly alcoholic, served in ceramic cups that did not match because no two potters in the city made the same cup and nobody had ever seen the need to try.</p>
    <p>The Antarctikans looked at the food the way he looked at blown glass before it cooled: as a problem with a shape that had not yet resolved.</p>
    <p>I see you, he thought. I see that you do not know what this is.</p>
    <p>He watched them eat. Their movements were careful, analytical — small portions lifted, examined, placed in the mouth with the deliberation of researchers handling samples. The tall one, Kavya, the biologist, sniffed the mackerel before tasting it. Her expression cycled through something he could not read. The mesh-connected faces did that: rapid micro-adjustments, as though the muscles were receiving instructions from a source faster than instinct.</p>
    <p>Sūrya sat at the center of the delegation's line. She ate the way she did everything — with complete attention, each action discrete, cataloged. She took a piece of the salt bread first. Chewed. Swallowed. Took another piece. Her face gave nothing.</p>
    <p>Then she reached for the roasted carrots.</p>
    <p>Kael had glazed them with chili oil. Not much. Enough. A Continental child would have eaten them without comment. Sūrya put one in her mouth, and for two seconds nothing happened, and then her eyes widened and filled with water.</p>
    <p>She set down her fork. She pressed her fingertips to the table's edge. Her jaw worked — not chewing, processing. The tears ran and she did not wipe them and Kael understood, with the clarity of watching a crack propagate through cooling glass, that she did not know what was happening to her face.</p>
    <p>Moss, seated at the table's corner where he could see both sides, said: "It's the pepper. Burns the mouth. Makes the eyes water. Normal."</p>
    <p>Sūrya blinked. She touched her cheek where the tear had tracked and looked at the moisture on her fingertip as though it were a substance she had not produced before. Perhaps it was. Perhaps Antarctic food had never given her a reason.</p>
    <p>She picked up another carrot.</p>
    <p>She ate it. Her eyes watered again. She ate a third. A fourth. Her hand moved to the plate with an urgency that had nothing to do with nutrition — a reaching, a grasping that was not hunger but something adjacent to it, something that lived in the same body as hunger but answered to a different name. She ate the carrots until the plate was bare and her lips were red and her eyes were streaming and she had not spoken a word.</p>
    <p>Kael refilled her cup with the cloudberry drink. She drank it in two swallows. The tartness cut the burn. She set the cup down and looked at him and her expression was the first one he had been able to read since the delegation arrived: more.</p>
    <p>He gave her more.</p>
    <hr class="scene-break">
    <p>The evening gathering took place in the open court below the glassworks, where the kilns' residual heat kept the air warm even after sundown. Lanterns hung from iron hooks set into the stone walls — actual flame, oil-fed, unsteady. The light moved. Sūrya observed this. In Antarctica, light did not move. Light was emitted at calibrated spectra, maintained at consistent lux, adjusted for circadian optimization. It did not flicker. It did not cast shadows that shifted when the wind came through the courtyard gate.</p>
    <p>She sat on a stone bench. The stone was warm from the day's sun and the kilns' bleed heat. Warmth from below, cool air from above. Her body registered the gradient. The mesh would have quantified it — surface temperature, ambient temperature, rate of heat loss through her clothing. The mesh was quiet. She had learned to make it quiet. Twelve months of practice since that night in the observation dome, and the silence was no longer vertigo. It was a room she could enter.</p>
    <p>A man with a stringed instrument — six strings, a wooden body shaped like a figure eight, crude by any engineering standard — sat on an upturned crate and began to play.</p>
    <p>The music was imprecise. The tuning deviated from equal temperament by margins that would have been corrected in any Antarctic composition system before the first note sounded. The man's fingers found the strings with a confidence that was not accuracy. He missed a note in the fourth bar. He compensated in the fifth. The melody was built on a minor scale that shifted to major in the chorus and back to minor in the verse and the transition was not mathematically motivated but emotionally — a lift and a fall, a breath taken and released.</p>
    <p>He sang. The song was about a woman who had gone to sea and not returned. The words were Continental Standard, which Sūrya understood now at perhaps sixty percent through Moss's patient instruction over the ocean crossing. Enough. She understood enough. The woman had gone to sea. The sea had kept her. The singer waited on the shore. The song did not resolve — it ended on the fifth, suspended, the question of return left open.</p>
    <p>Moss sang along. He was not good at this. His voice cracked on the high notes and arrived late on the low ones and he knew the words imperfectly, filling gaps with humming. He did not seem to notice or to care. He leaned against the courtyard wall with his arms crossed and his modified eyes — the amber had spread to cover nearly half the iris now — half-closed, and he sang the way he did most things: with commitment and without precision.</p>
    <p>The song ended. The courtyard was quiet for four seconds. Then someone from the Continental side struck a hand against a table — once, twice — and others joined, a percussive approval that was nothing like the structured response protocols of an Antarctic performance.</p>
    <p>Kavya stood. She had brought an instrument from the ship — a small device, half-mechanical, half-electronic, no larger than two cupped hands. She placed it on the bench beside Sūrya and activated it, and it produced a tone — pure, clean, mathematically derived. Then a second tone, a perfect fifth above. Then a cascade: an algorithmic composition that built itself from a seed phrase according to rules of harmonic progression that were themselves derived from the physics of wave interference in bounded media. The music was a proof. Each phrase followed from the previous by logical necessity. The beauty of it was the beauty of inevitability — of watching a geometric construction unfold from its axioms.</p>
    <p>The Continentals listened. Their faces showed the same disorientation the Antarctikans had shown during the folk song. The music was too clean. Too certain. It arrived at its conclusions without struggle, and the absence of struggle made it alien to people for whom music was an argument between the hand and the string and the voice and the air.</p>
    <p>Neither side applauded. Both sides were quiet. The quiet was not hostile. It was the quiet of two people who have shown each other something private and are waiting to see if the showing was a mistake.</p>
    <p>A child — five years old, perhaps six, a girl with dark curly hair and a smear of kiln ash on her cheek — detached from the cluster of Continental families near the courtyard wall. She walked across the open space between the two groups with the directness that only children have, the directness that does not account for politics or protocol or the accumulated weight of five centuries of separation. She walked to Kavya, who was still seated, and reached out and took the biologist's hand.</p>
    <p>Kavya flinched. Her hand pulled back three centimeters — involuntary, trained, the consent protocol that governed all Antarctic physical contact asserting itself before conscious thought could intervene. Unsolicited touch. Unannounced. A child's hand in hers without request or permission or the structured negotiation that preceded every act of physical intimacy in the habitats.</p>
    <p>The child did not let go. Her fingers held Kavya's with the unselfconscious grip of someone who had not yet learned that touch required permission. She looked up at Kavya with the expression that children use when they have decided something and are waiting for the adult world to catch up.</p>
    <p>Kavya did not pull away again. Her hand opened. The child's fingers settled into hers — small, warm, ash-streaked. Kavya looked at the hand holding hers and her face did something that Sūrya had no classification for, because it was not an expression the mesh had ever needed to catalog. It was surrender to a kindness that had not been optimized.</p>
    <p>Sūrya touched her left ear. The callus was thick under her thumb. She pressed it and watched Kavya hold the child's hand and thought: this is what it looks like when the protocol is wrong and you follow the hand instead.</p>
    <hr class="scene-break">
    <p>They met at the top of the seawall after the others had gone inside. Kael, Sūrya, Moss. The three of them and the dark ocean and the sky.</p>
    <p>I think this is important, Kael thought. I think what is happening right now is the most important thing that has happened in this city in my lifetime, and I do not know how to make it matter more than it already does.</p>
    <p>He sat on the wall's edge, legs hanging over. Below, the harbor water moved against the pylons — a sound he had known since birth, so constant he usually did not hear it. Tonight he heard it. Sūrya sat three meters to his right, upright, her posture the economical stillness of a person whose body had been trained to waste nothing, not even the energy of slouching. Moss sat between them, leaning back on his hands, the translator and the bridge and the man who had somehow become the hinge between two worlds.</p>
    <p>"Ask her something," Moss said to Kael. "Something real. Not policy."</p>
    <p>Kael looked at Sūrya. Her face in the dark was a study in planes and angles, lit faintly by the harbor lanterns below. The mesh implant at her temple was invisible in this light. She could have been anyone. She could have been a Continental woman sitting on a wall looking at the sea. She was not. She was the farthest thing from anyone he had ever met, and the distance between them was not measured in kilometers.</p>
    <p>"What is it like," he said, and Moss began translating before the sentence was complete, the pidgin and the scraps of Satya and the gestures flowing from him like water finding its level, "to always know what to do?"</p>
    <p>Moss translated. Sūrya was quiet for six seconds. Then she spoke — in Satya first, then correcting herself, switching to the pidgin, the simplified structures that carried less nuance but traveled farther.</p>
    <p>"Efficient," she said. Moss relayed it. "Empty."</p>
    <p>One word for the system. One word for what the system cost. Kael turned them over. Glass metaphors came: a vessel with no flaw and no color. A perfect transparency that let everything through and held nothing. He kept them to himself.</p>
    <p>"What is it like," he said, "to have never seen a sunset by choice?"</p>
    <p>The question was not fair. He knew it was not fair. He asked it anyway, because fairness was a form of distance and he did not want distance. He wanted to know.</p>
    <p>Moss translated. The question took longer this time — the concept of <em>by choice</em> was slippery in the pidgin, requiring a detour through <em>wanting-to</em> and <em>not-told-to</em> and a gesture Moss made with his open hand that meant something like <em>from the inside out.</em></p>
    <p>Sūrya's hand went to her left ear. She held the callus between thumb and forefinger and was quiet for eleven seconds. Then she spoke, and her voice was different from any voice Kael had heard her use — not the formal register of the delegation meetings, not the careful pidgin of cross-cultural exchange. Something underneath both. Something that had been loosened by salt air and burned carrots and a child's hand in a biologist's palm.</p>
    <p>"I have now," she said. Moss translated, but Kael had understood the pidgin words before the Continental rendering caught up. "On the ocean. It was — " She stopped. Tried again. Stopped. Her hand pressed harder against her ear. She turned to Moss and spoke to him directly, in the mix of pidgin and Satya and gesture that was theirs alone, the private language of two people who had crossed an ocean together.</p>
    <p>"Moss. How do you say a thing that is beautiful because it has no reason?"</p>
    <p>Moss was quiet. The harbor water moved below them. A lantern on a moored boat swung with the swell, painting a line of amber light across the dark surface, back and forth, back and forth.</p>
    <p>"I don't think we have that word either," Moss said.</p>
    <p>The three of them sat on the seawall. The ocean did what oceans do — moved, and did not explain itself, and was not diminished by their inability to describe it. Kael thought about glass. About how the best pieces were the ones where the color happened by accident — a contaminant in the silica, an unplanned interaction between metal oxides, a flaw that became the reason the piece was worth keeping. He thought about the word that did not exist in any of their languages and wondered if the absence of the word was itself a kind of proof that the thing it described was real. You do not need a word for something that does not exist. You need a word for something that exists and has been overlooked.</p>
    <p>He did not say this. He sat on the wall and let the silence hold what the words could not.</p>
    <hr class="scene-break">
    <p>The days accumulated.</p>
    <p>Sūrya observed their accumulation with the attention she had once reserved for data sets — not counting, not measuring, but tracking the shape of a pattern as it emerged from noise. Day five. Day six. Day seven. The pattern was not linear. It advanced and retreated and advanced again, like the tide in this harbor that she had learned to watch without consulting the mesh for its schedule.</p>
    <p>Kavya spent the morning of day six in the Continental herbalists' quarter. Sūrya accompanied her and stood at the edge of the workshop while the biologist examined dried plant specimens with an intensity that bordered on devotion. The Continental pharmacopoeia was vast, unsystematic, organized by tradition rather than taxonomy. Kavya's hands trembled as she turned over a bundle of dried yarrow — not from cold, not from fear, but from the specific agitation of a scientist confronting a body of knowledge that should not work and does. "Five hundred years," Kavya said to Sūrya in Satya, her voice tight with something that was not anger. "Five hundred years they have been treating infections with this. There is no controlled trial. There is no mechanism study. There is no — " She stopped. Held the yarrow to her nose. Inhaled. Set it down with a care that contradicted everything she had just said.</p>
    <p>A Continental scholar — an older man, white-haired, whose name Sūrya had learned was Petros — asked through Moss to see how the mesh stored information. Not the politics of it. The architecture. Sūrya explained: distributed memory, shared across nodes, redundant, persistent, accessible to any connected citizen at the speed of thought. Petros listened and his eyes went distant and he said, "We lose so much. Every generation, we lose things. A technique for glazing. A song. The name of a plant. We write it down and the paper rots or the building burns or the person who understood what the words meant dies and the words remain but the understanding does not." He paused. "You lose nothing." Sūrya said, "We lose nothing that can be stored." He heard the distinction. She saw him hear it. He nodded and did not ask what could not be stored, because they both already knew.</p>
    <p>Day eight. Shared meals had become routine. The Antarctikans no longer arranged themselves in precise geometries at the table. The spacing had loosened — not Continental-loose, not elbow-to-elbow, but measurably less rigid. Sūrya found herself seated next to Kael on the second evening and did not move. He ate the way he worked: fast, focused, impatient, his hands tearing the bread with the same economical force she imagined he used on his glass. He passed her the chili oil without being asked. She used it. Her eyes watered. She did not mind. The burn had become familiar — not pleasant, not unpleasant, but <em>known</em>, a sensation she had chosen to repeat, and the choice was the point.</p>
    <p>Day nine. She walked through the city with Moss. The streets were unpaved in the lower quarters, packed earth and gravel, and her boots — Antarctic-issued, designed for smooth habitat floors — slipped on the uneven ground. Moss caught her elbow when she stumbled. She did not flinch. She noted the absence of the flinch. Four days ago she would have flinched. The consent protocol was deep — deeper than thought, wired into the motor cortex by a lifetime of structured physical interaction. Its erosion was not a decision. It was an accumulation of evidence: that unsolicited touch in this place was not a violation but a vocabulary. That a hand on an elbow meant <em>I am here</em> and nothing more and nothing less.</p>
    <p>Children followed them. Two, then four, then six, trailing at a distance of ten meters that shrank as the morning went on. By midday the smallest was walking beside Sūrya, matching her pace with the exaggerated seriousness of a child imitating an adult, and Sūrya adjusted her stride to accommodate legs that were a third the length of hers. She did not consult the mesh for the optimal walking speed. She watched the child and matched her. The adjustment was imprecise. It was adequate.</p>
    <p>Day ten. No breakthrough. No document signed. No formal agreement that would satisfy the Council or the Continental governing assembly or the historians who would, Sūrya understood, eventually construct a narrative in which this week either mattered or did not. What had been built could not be put in a document. It was the biologist holding a child's hand. It was a scholar nodding at a distinction he had not been told to notice. It was the space between two people at a table — wider than Continentals kept, narrower than Antarctikans required — a compromise measured in centimeters that neither side had negotiated because neither side had needed to. The distance had found itself.</p>
    <p>Understanding had not been achieved. Sūrya did not expect it to be achieved. Understanding was a terminus, and they were not at the terminus. They were at the trailhead. What had been achieved was something that preceded understanding the way the foundation precedes the structure: the willingness to be in the same room. To eat the same food and let it burn. To listen to music that made no sense and recognize, in the not-understanding, that the music mattered to the person playing it, and that mattering was itself a thing worth sitting still for.</p>
    <p>She stood on the seawall on the evening of day ten and watched the sunset. The sky did what Moss had once described to her in a glass dome on the other side of the world: red that was not the color of burning but the color after, when the heat was leaving and the light remained. Orange on the water. The water moving, the sky still, the colors on the surface broken and reformed and broken again. She watched it without the mesh and without purpose and without counting the seconds. She had been practicing. She was getting better at it. The purposelessness still frightened her, a low hum of wrongness that she suspected would never fully resolve. But she could sit with it now. She could let it be present without letting it drive her back to the safety of optimization.</p>
    <p>The sun touched the horizon. The light turned the color that had no name. She did not try to name it. She let it be unnamed, and stayed, and watched.</p>
