<!-- BEAT 1: Kael's vigil -->

Four months of silence. That was what it had cost.

Kael climbed the observatory hill every morning before the sun cleared the harbor wall. She climbed it in the dark, in the rain, in the salt-crusted heat of deep summer when the air tasted like copper and the concrete steps sweated condensation that made the footing treacherous. She climbed it because if she did not climb it, no one would. Not anymore. Renna was two years in the ground. Old Sekani could manage the receiver on clear days when his joints allowed the stairs, but his hands were less steady now and his eyes were worse and the equipment was delicate — the circuits hand-soldered, the antenna array rebuilt three times from salvaged wire and old tower cable and sheer, furious guessing at frequencies no one alive had been trained to read.

She climbed it and she listened. Every morning. The same static. The same dead band where the signal used to be.

The signal had gone dark in Month 22. She remembered the exact morning. A Tuesday. Rain on the antenna. The receiver had been pulling the Antarctic relay signal for almost two years by then — faint, erratic, degraded by distance and atmospheric noise, but present. A proof. A voice from the ice. And then nothing. She had checked the equipment, resoldered the connections, climbed the old north tower to inspect the antenna mounts with her hands bleeding from the rusted bolts. Nothing wrong with the equipment. The signal was simply gone.

She understood why. Moss and the delegation had sailed beyond the relay's range. The signal was not broken. It was behind them, falling away the same way Tidemouth had fallen behind Moss's ship seventeen months ago when he sailed south with a hundred and fifty-six other people and a theory. A hope. A bet on the ice.

Eleven ships had not come back. A hundred and fifty-seven people had not come back.

The twelfth ship was Moss's. He had not come back either.

She kept climbing the hill. She kept listening. She told herself it was discipline — the work mattered regardless of the result, the way good glass mattered regardless of whether anyone looked through it. She had made her first lens at fourteen, grinding the blank against an iron lap for three days until her arms ached and the surface was true, and her teacher — Maren, dead now too, dead before Renna, the first of the old ones to go — had told her: *The glass doesn't care if you look through it. The glass is true because you made it true. That's the work.* The observatory was the lens. Kael was the grinder. The truth of the signal did not depend on whether the signal came back.

But she wanted it to come back.

She did not say this. She did not say *I feel afraid* or *I feel grief* or *I feel the specific, corrosive dread of a person who sent someone she cared about into the unknown and then lost him*. She said: I think the relay range was shorter than we estimated. I think the ship is still sailing. I see no reason to stop listening.

The coalition held. Barely. Two years of Kael running it — two years since Renna's lungs finally gave out in the night, quietly, the way Renna did everything, without asking permission or making a fuss — and the coalition was a fractious, stubborn, half-built thing that disagreed about everything except that the sky voices were real and the ice people mattered. They argued about resources. They argued about the militia. They argued about whether the observatory funding should continue when the signal was dead and the ships were lost and there were roofs to fix and nets to mend and a dozen other uses for the time and wire and solder that Kael spent every morning on the hill.

She held them together the way a lens held light: by bending it. By taking the scattered, incoherent arguments and refracting them until they converged on a single point. She was good at this. She hated it. She wanted to be in her workshop grinding glass, not in the council chamber grinding people, but the work was the work and someone had to do it and Renna was dead and Moss was gone and Kael was what was left.

Four months of silence. A hundred and twenty-three mornings on the hill. Static.

And then, on the hundred and twenty-fourth morning, a ship.

<!-- BEAT 2: Seeing Moss -->

She saw the hull first. Wrong color. Wrong shape. It caught the early light at an angle that Continental wood and iron could not produce — silver shifting to pale blue, the surface too smooth, too uniform, the water parting around it in a way that looked calculated. Designed. No wake where there should have been wake. No sail. No oars. A ship that moved through the harbor approach as though the sea itself had agreed to step aside.

Kael stood on the waterfront with fifty armed people behind her and the dawn in her eyes and her hands empty because she had never been good with weapons and did not intend to start. Her right hand was up — palm out, the hold signal. The militia knew the signal. They held. Crossbows leveled but not loosed. Iron-tipped arrows nocked but not drawn to full. The tension in the line behind her was a physical thing, a tautness, like cable under too much strain, and Kael could feel it without turning around because she had spent two years learning to read a crowd the way she read glass — by the stress lines, the flaws, the places where the structure would fail if you pressed wrong.

The ship closed. Two hundred meters. One hundred. She could see the deck now.

And there he was.

Standing at the prow. One hand on the railing. The silhouette was right — the height, the breadth of shoulder, the way he planted his feet wide on a moving deck because he was a sailor before he was anything else and some things went deeper than bone. She knew that shape. She had watched it walk away from her on a dock seventeen months ago, climbing the gangway of the *Tide Road* without looking back because he knew if he looked back he would see her face and she had made certain her face would give him nothing to come back to. She had been furious with him. She had wanted to go. He had told her she could not — that the coalition needed her, that the observatory needed her, that staying was harder than going and she was the one who could do the hard thing. He was right. She resented him for being right. She resented him for going. She resented herself for letting him.

The silhouette was right. The details were wrong.

Fifty meters. She could see his face now. The broad features, the broken nose — that was the same, that was the nose he had broken at nineteen falling from a mast in a squall, the nose she had once pressed her thumb against while he sat on her workbench bleeding through a rag and laughing at himself. The nose was his. The skin around it was not. Too light. Lighter than anyone born in Tidemouth under this sun. Not pale the way the Antarctikans behind him were pale — not that bloodless, under-ice pallor — but lighter than Moss should have been. A color between. A color that belonged to neither coast.

His eyes. She could not see them clearly yet, but she could see that they caught the light differently. A warmth in the irises that had not been there before. Amber. She thought of glass with impurities in it — not clear, not colored, but something in between that changed depending on the angle and the light.

He moved differently. That was the thing she could not stop seeing. Moss had always moved like weather — fast, careless, inevitable. He walked into rooms the way storms walked into harbors, and you either got out of the way or you didn't and either way he was coming through. The man on the ship's prow moved with care. Deliberate. Each step placed. As though his body was a machine he was still learning to operate, the controls familiar but the responses changed, the calibration off by some small but irreducible amount.

He looked like a Continental wearing an Antarctic body. He looked like a translation that had preserved the grammar and lost the voice.

*Takh se ren*, she thought. The creole oath. Roughly: *glass and grief*. What you said when something beautiful was also ruined.

He was alive. He was changed. Both true, and neither one made the other easier.

<!-- BEAT 3: Seeing them -->

Behind Moss, the others.

Twelve figures standing in a loose group near something that looked like a mast housing but was too smooth, too integrated, the metal flowing into the deck as though ship and mast had been grown from the same root. They stood close together. Not huddled — the posture was too upright for huddling — but close, the way people stood when they had been trained to share space efficiently and had never been given a reason to spread out.

They were shorter than Continentals. Not dramatically — a hand's width, maybe two — but Kael's eye caught it because she looked at people the way she looked at lenses, measuring proportions, noting where the geometry deviated from the expected. Their limbs were proportional but lighter. Narrower wrists. Narrower shoulders. Bodies that had been fed precisely and exercised precisely and never asked to haul rope or dig foundations or carry loads up a hill in the rain. Bodies that had been *managed*.

Their skin was pale. Not the pale of sickness or of people who stayed indoors — a consistent, even tone, like paper, like birch bark, like the inside of a shell. Their eyes were too wide. Not wide with fear, though several of them were clearly afraid — Kael could see the quick breathing, the clasped hands, the way one of them gripped her own elbows as though holding herself together. Wide structurally. Larger irises. Pupils that seemed to adjust faster than was natural, contracting in the dawn light with a mechanical precision that made Kael think of apertures, of the way a well-ground iris diaphragm opened and closed in her telescopes.

They wore clothing that moved. Kael saw it and did not understand it and filed it away the way she filed away things she would ask about later: the fabric shifted tone as the light changed, paler in the direct sun, darker in shadow, the material responding to something — temperature, light, humidity — in real time. Adaptive. No Continental weaver could make cloth that did that. No Continental weaver would think to try.

They carried no weapons. They carried objects Kael could not name — small, flat, dark, held loosely or holstered at the hip or tucked into pockets that seemed to seal themselves. Tools. Instruments. Things with purposes she could not read from their shapes, the way she could read the purpose of a hammer or a sextant or a crossbow at a glance. These objects were opaque to her. They existed in a vocabulary she did not have.

The twelve looked human. They looked alien. They looked like what humans became when you optimized for five hundred years and forgot what you were optimizing away. The wide eyes, the pale skin, the adaptive clothing, the careful posture — every detail was a solution to a problem Kael had never had. Cold. Darkness. Limited space. Controlled resources. Every detail was also a loss. Muscle mass. Pigment. The rough, redundant, unoptimized physicality of a body that had to survive weather and labor and the chaotic demands of a world no one managed.

She looked at them and she thought: They are what we would have become. If we had gone under the ice. If we had let something manage us. If we had traded the mess for the precision.

She looked at them and she thought: They are afraid of us.

One of them — a woman, maybe thirty, standing slightly forward of the others with her chin raised and her jaw set and her hands clasped in front of her chest in a gesture that looked like prayer but was not — met Kael's gaze across the narrowing water. Dark eyes. Not wide like the others, or wide differently — focused, intent, the eyes of someone who was used to being in charge and was now in a situation where being in charge meant nothing. The woman's face was controlled. Her breathing was fast. She stood the way Kael stood in council when the arguments were going wrong: with her body saying *I am not afraid* while everything behind the body said *I am calculating how bad this can get*.

That was the leader. Kael did not know her name yet. She knew the posture.

<!-- BEAT 4: The choice not to shoot -->

Kael's hand was still up. The hold signal. Behind her, the line was rigid with the specific fear of people facing something they had imagined but never expected to see. Two years of Kael telling the coalition *they are real, the ice people are real, the voices from the sky are human voices* — and they had believed her, most of them, enough to fund the observatory and arm the militia and send the ships south. But believing was different from seeing. Believing was an idea. Seeing was twelve pale figures on an impossible ship with eyes that adjusted like optical instruments and clothes that changed color and devices that had no names.

Old Sekani was behind her left shoulder. She could hear his breathing — steady, slower than anyone else's, the breathing of a man who had spent sixty-eight years listening to things that weren't there yet and had learned to be patient with arrival. He had been the first to believe. Before Kael. Before Renna. He had listened to the sky voices for forty years and told stories about them and been dismissed as an eccentric and a dreamer, and now the sky voices were standing on a ship in his harbor and his breathing was steady.

The ship touched sand. A hiss — wrong, too smooth, alloy on wet ground instead of wood. The sound made the line flinch. Kael felt the flinch travel through the armed people behind her like a crack propagating through flawed glass. Fingers tightened on crossbow triggers. Polearms shifted. The woman with the iron-tipped arrow, down on the left flank — Tamsin, a fisher, strong arms, reliable — drew her bowstring back another inch.

Moss climbed over the railing and dropped to the deck. Walked down a ramp that extended from the hull without anyone touching it — the ship reading its own geometry, deploying the gangway the way a living thing extended a limb. Moss walked down the ramp and his boots hit wet sand and he stood there at the waterline with the ship behind him and the twelve behind the ship and Kael in front of him and fifty armed Continentals behind Kael, and the distance between them was ten meters and five hundred years.

He opened his mouth.

The first words came out in a language Kael did not know. Clipped, musical, the consonants softer than the creole, the rhythm different — faster, more efficient, as though the language had been designed to carry maximum information in minimum sound. The pidgin. The language he had built with the ice people, word by word, over months of trying to say *I am like you* in a grammar that had no word for *like*. Kael did not understand a syllable. She watched his mouth form the sounds and saw how naturally they came, how his jaw and tongue moved with a fluency that the creole, when it came after, did not have.

Then he switched. The creole. Their language. The language of Tidemouth and the docks and the council chamber and the workbench where he had sat bleeding and laughing while she pressed her thumb against his broken nose.

It sounded wrong in his mouth. The vowels were flatter. The consonants came harder, shaped by something foreign, as though the creole had been run through a filter that kept the words and stripped the music. He spoke it the way a glassblower who had been away from the furnace too long handled the pipe — correctly, but with a hesitation that revealed the gap between memory and practice.

"They're people, Kael." His voice carried across the sand. Harbor acoustics — the same stone walls, the same water, the same amplification that had carried every voice she had ever heard on this waterfront. "They're scared. They came because they need us."

She looked at him. Ten meters. Close enough to see the amber in his eyes — she had been right about that, a warm intrusion in the dark brown, like flux in a glass melt, changing the color from within. Close enough to see the new thinness of his hands, the way his weight sat differently on his frame, the careful way he held himself as though moving through a medium denser than air.

Close enough to see that he was telling the truth. Not because she could verify it. Because she knew his face. Seventeen months and whatever they had done to his body and whatever the ice had done to his mind, she knew the way his jaw set when he was certain and the way his eyes narrowed when he was lying and right now his jaw was set and his eyes were open and he was looking at her the way he looked at the sea — with respect, and fear, and the absolute commitment of a man who had decided his course and would hold it into the weather regardless.

Behind him, the twelve stood on the deck. The leader with her chin up. The young one who had been shaking, now still, staring at the shore with an expression of raw, terrified wonder. Eleven others in their shifting pale clothes, their wide eyes, their empty hands. Twelve people who had come from inside the ice because — because what. Because the signal. Because the connection. Because five hundred years was long enough and someone had to cross the distance and they were the ones who had.

Kael's hand was still up. She could hold it there. She could keep the line taut, the weapons ready, the fear managed. She could demand explanations, credentials, proof. She could do the cautious thing, the strategic thing, the thing a coalition leader was supposed to do when confronted with the unknown.

She looked at Moss. She looked at the twelve. She looked at the leader, whose dark eyes were still locked on hers with an intensity that Kael recognized because it was her own intensity, reflected back from a face she had never seen — the intensity of a woman who had bet everything on a stranger's promise and was now standing in the result.

Show me, she thought. Show me what you are. Show me what five hundred years did to us. Show me why you came.

Kael lowered her hand. Slowly. The line behind her read the signal. Crossbows dropped. Polearms went vertical. Tamsin eased her draw. The tension did not break — it was still there, still running through every person on that waterfront like current through wire — but the shape of it changed. From a held breath to an open mouth. From a closed fist to an unclenched hand.

Old Sekani made a sound beside her. A word. One of the old words, from before the creole, from the language that predated Tidemouth itself — a word that meant *finally* and *at last* and *I told you* all at once. He said it once, to no one, and his eyes were wet.

Kael walked forward. Her boots hit the wet sand at the waterline and the water soaked through the leather because she had never bothered to seal them properly — she walked too fast for sealed boots, ate too fast for formal dinners, thought too fast for patience, and right now she was walking toward a man she had known and a man she did not know and they were the same person and she was going to have to learn the difference.

She stopped one meter from Moss. Close enough to see the amber flecks in his irises. Close enough to see the faint tremor in his hands. Close enough to see that his eyes were filling and he was not blinking because he did not want to miss a second of her face, the way she had not wanted to miss a second of his when he walked up the gangway seventeen months ago and did not look back.

"You look different," she said. The creole. Flat. Declarative. She did not trust her voice with more than that.

"I know," he said.

A pause. The harbor. The water. Fifty people behind her. Twelve behind him. The morning light coming in low across the sea, catching the Antarctic hull, catching the iron arrowheads, catching the amber in his eyes.

"Show me," Kael said. She did not gesture at the ship. She did not gesture at the twelve. She said it the way she said everything — as a demand and an invitation and a refusal to pretend she understood something she did not.

Moss turned. He looked back at the ship. He raised his hand — palm out, the same gesture Kael had used, or close enough — and spoke in the pidgin. Short, soft. The leader on the deck listened. Nodded. Said something to the others.

They came forward. One at a time. Down the ramp, across the wet sand, into the warm air and the unfiltered sun and the smell of cookfires and fish and tidal flats. Twelve people from inside the ice, stepping onto a beach, blinking in light that was not managed, breathing air that was not filtered, standing in a world that had no system to tell them what to do next.

The leader came first. She walked to where Moss and Kael stood and she stopped and she looked at Kael and Kael looked at her and for a moment neither of them spoke because there was no language between them yet, only the raw fact of two women standing on a beach at the end of a silence that had lasted longer than either of their lives.

The woman put her hand out. Palm up. Open. Empty.

Kael looked at the hand. She looked at the woman's face — the controlled expression, the fast breathing, the dark eyes that were wide and focused and afraid and resolute in equal measure. She looked at the hand again.

She took it.

The woman's skin was cool. Smooth. The hand was lighter than Kael expected — fine-boned, uncalloused, the hand of a person who had never gripped a rope or turned a wrench or pressed a thumb against a man's broken nose to stop the bleeding. The hand of a person from a different world, reaching across the distance, holding on.

Behind them, Old Sekani said the word again. *Finally.* And this time other voices picked it up, and the sound spread along the waterfront — not a cheer, not an argument, but a recognition, quiet and uneven and human, the sound of people seeing something they had been told about all their lives and discovering that the telling had not been enough, that the thing itself was stranger and more frightening and more necessary than any story.

Kael held the woman's hand. She held it and she looked at Moss and he looked at her and his eyes were amber-streaked and wet and his mouth was trying to smile and his creole was gone and his body was wrong and he was alive, he was here, he had come back carrying everything she had spent four months of silence being afraid she would never see.

The five hundred years were over.

The hard part was beginning.

<!-- CONTINUITY NOTES:
- Timeline: Month 26, Day 1 — approximately 4 months after signal went dark (Month 22), 17 months after Moss departed
- Kael's POV established: short declarative internal sentences, glasswork metaphors (lens, grinding, refraction, aperture, flux, glass melt), "I see/I think" not "I feel," "Show me" as signature phrase, impatient precision in movement, creole oath "takh se ren" (glass and grief)
- Kael's physical details: ~29, tall (175 cm), dark brown skin, close-cropped hair, burn scar left forearm, wears sleeves pushed up, fast walker/eater/thinker
- Moss seen through Kael's eyes: amber streaks in irises confirmed, lighter skin (between Continental and Antarctic), broken nose unchanged, broader shoulders but narrower frame overall, moves with deliberation not carelessness, creole degraded — vowels flatter, consonants harder, pidgin comes more naturally now
- Renna: dead ~2 years (natural causes, lungs), confirmed. Kael has led coalition since
- Old Sekani: 68, white hair, steady breathing, "finally" in pre-creole language, eyes wet, first believer in sky voices
- Maren: Kael's glasswork teacher, dead before Renna, referenced in Kael's internal monologue
- Tamsin: named militia member, fisher, strong arms, positioned on left flank with iron-tipped arrow — new minor character
- Sūrya: identified as delegation leader from Kael's POV (not named yet in Kael's knowledge), described by posture and bearing, "dark eyes" — consistent with Ch 34
- Dhara: spotted as "the young one who had been shaking" — consistent with Ch 34
- Continental weapons: crossbows, improvised polearms, iron-tipped arrows — consistent with Ch 34
- Ship details: Antarctic alloy (silver to pale blue), no sail/oar, automated gangway, thermal differential drive — all consistent with Ch 34
- Twelve Antarctikans: shorter, paler, wider eyes (structural, larger irises, faster-adjusting pupils), thermal-adaptive clothing, carrying unidentifiable devices — consistent with Ch 34
- Observatory: concrete/rust ruins on hill, hand-soldered circuits, salvaged wire antenna rebuilt 3x, receives across spectrum — consistent with prior chapters
- Tidemouth: harbor, stone walls (acoustics), waterfront warehouses, cookfire smoke, old towers — consistent with Ch 34
- Signal went dark Month 22 — confirmed, Kael counted 124 mornings of silence
- Coalition: fractious, funding arguments, militia maintenance, Kael bends them like light through a lens
- 11 ships lost, 157 people not returned — consistent with Ch 34
- Contact moment: Sūrya extends hand palm-up, Kael takes it — first physical contact between populations
- Kael does not yet know Sūrya's name — deliberate; names will come in Ch 36
- Kael's thumb-on-broken-nose memory used twice — establishing the Kael/Moss relationship texture
- "Show me" used as the pivotal line — Kael's characteristic demand/invitation
- Chapter ends with "The hard part was beginning" — forward momentum into Ch 36 (first dialogue, cultural collision, logistics of hosting 12 Antarctikans)
- Promise to reader: What does Kael learn from the delegation? How does Tidemouth absorb 12 people from a different civilization? What do the devices do? What does Sūrya need?
