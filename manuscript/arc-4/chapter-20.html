    <p>She had explained the mesh to Moss fourteen times.</p>
    <p>Fourteen attempts across six weeks, each one a different approach, each one failing at the same wall. The mesh was not a device. It was not a program. It was not a voice in the wall, though Moss had that too now, the audio interface clipped behind his right ear that let VEDA speak to him in the pidgin it was learning faster than either of them. The mesh was something else. The SADHU Network was an experience, and experience did not survive translation.</p>
    <p>So she stopped explaining. She arranged a demonstration instead.</p>
    <p>The room was a maintenance bay on Level 12, a space she had chosen because it was functional and unadorned — no aesthetic treatments, no bioluminescent panels shaped to suggest open sky. Just walls, tools, and two of her colleagues standing three meters apart.</p>
    <p>"I observe them," she said to Moss. She had learned to announce her observations this way, a formality she had always maintained but that now served a second purpose: giving him a frame for what he was about to witness. "Tarini and Javed. They will exchange a concept. A technical concept — the repair schedule for the water reclamation filters on this level. It would require many words between us."</p>
    <p>Moss stood beside her. He was taller than anyone in the habitat by nearly a full head, and even after ten weeks he had not learned to carry that height with the economy the habitat's corridors demanded. He bumped things. Ducked late through doorways. Occupied space the way weather occupied space — without apology.</p>
    <p>He nodded. He was watching Tarini and Javed with the focused attention she had come to recognize as his default state. Moss watched everything. He watched the way a sailor watched water: continuously, without apparent effort, missing nothing.</p>
    <p>Tarini and Javed stood facing each other. They did not speak. Tarini's eyes shifted — a slight defocus, the pupils dilating by a fraction of a millimeter as the mesh routed her conceptual query. Javed's eyes did the same. For one and a half seconds they were elsewhere, inhabiting a shared information space that existed between their respective neural interfaces and VEDA's mediation layer. Then Javed's eyes sharpened. He nodded. Tarini turned and walked toward the filter bank on the far wall.</p>
    <p>Three seconds. The entire exchange.</p>
    <p>"That is it," Surya said.</p>
    <p>Moss said nothing for a moment. She had learned that his silences were not empty. They were processing intervals, the same way VEDA's processing intervals preceded complex output — except that Moss's processing was opaque to her, unlogged, unreadable.</p>
    <p>"What did they say?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Tarini proposed a modification to the filter replacement rotation. Javed evaluated the proposal against the maintenance data he holds as section lead. He agreed with one amendment — the timing of the third-cycle flush. She accepted the amendment. Consensus."</p>
    <p>"Three seconds."</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"That would take us thirty minutes," Moss said. "In our words. With the pointing and the drawing."</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>He looked at Tarini, now crouched beside the filter bank, her hands moving with the precision of someone who knew exactly what she was doing and why. Then he looked at Surya.</p>
    <p>"Show me more," he said.</p>
    <p>She took him to the atmospheric processing junction on Level 8.</p>
    <p>A work crew of eight was gathered around an access panel. The panel was open, revealing a tangle of conduit and sensor arrays that monitored the gas composition of the habitat's southern residential block. Something had flagged an anomaly — a 0.3 percent deviation in the nitrogen-oxygen ratio that was within tolerance but trending in a direction that warranted discussion.</p>
    <p>Surya and Moss stood at the edge of the corridor, close enough to observe, far enough not to intrude. She did not announce them. The crew knew they were there. The mesh had informed them the moment Surya and Moss entered the corridor.</p>
    <p>"Eight people," she said. "They will assess the anomaly and determine a response. This is civic coordination — the fifth capability of the mesh."</p>
    <p>The crew stood in a loose semicircle. No one spoke. Surya could feel the mesh traffic as a faint warmth at the base of her skull — the characteristic sensation of multiple simultaneous inputs being routed through VEDA's arbitration layer. Each crew member was contributing data: their individual sensor readings, their experiential knowledge of this particular system, their assessment of priority relative to other maintenance needs. VEDA was receiving all eight inputs simultaneously, weighting them by relevance and expertise, integrating them into a consensus framework.</p>
    <p>Twelve seconds.</p>
    <p>One of the crew members — Aditi, the section coordinator — blinked twice, a common involuntary response to consensus lock. She reached into the access panel and adjusted a valve by a quarter turn. Another crew member handed her a calibration tool without being asked. The others dispersed. Two went left, toward the next junction. The rest continued down the corridor.</p>
    <p>No voices. No debate. No dissent. Not because dissent was forbidden — the mesh's architecture guaranteed that every input was weighted, every disagreement registered. But because eight people had simultaneously contributed their knowledge, VEDA had integrated it, and the optimal response had emerged in the time it took Moss to draw a single breath.</p>
    <p>Surya turned to observe his reaction.</p>
    <p>His face was the problem. She had spent ten weeks learning to read a face that operated by different rules than any she had known — a face that displayed its interior without mediation, without the precise control that every Antartikan learned before the age of four. Moss's face was a country without borders. Everything crossed it.</p>
    <p>What crossed it now was something she did not have a word for.</p>
    <p>He was not frightened. She had observed fright on him — the first day in the medical bay, the first time VEDA spoke through his audio interface. This was different. His mouth was slightly open, his brow drawn inward, his dark brown eyes moving between the dispersing crew members and the access panel and Surya herself. He was awed. He was also something else. Something that pulled his shoulders back and tightened his jaw and made him look, for a moment, like a man standing on the edge of deep water.</p>
    <p>Disturbed. That was the word. He was disturbed.</p>
    <p>And watching him — watching that reaction move across his unguarded face — Surya felt something shift in her own perception. A parallax. As though she had been looking at a painting her entire life and someone had stepped behind her and said: <em>look at the frame.</em></p>
    <p>She looked at the frame.</p>
    <p>Eight people had made a decision in twelve seconds without speaking. She had witnessed this ten thousand times. She had participated in it ten thousand times. It was the texture of her life, as unremarkable as breathing. But now she was observing it through the filter of Moss's reaction, and what she observed was this: eight people had stood in a corridor and surrendered their individual perspectives to a system that returned a single answer, and not one of them had hesitated, and not one of them had questioned the answer, and the whole exchange had been so smooth and so fast that it was indistinguishable from the absence of thought.</p>
    <p>She touched her left ear. The gesture was involuntary. She had been doing it since childhood and the mesh had long since categorized it as a low-priority stress indicator, not worthy of intervention.</p>
    <p>"Surya," Moss said. "Are they... is there a word. They all agreed?"</p>
    <p>"Consensus was reached."</p>
    <p>"But they did not talk about it."</p>
    <p>"They contributed simultaneously. VEDA integrated their inputs. The process is more thorough than verbal discussion. Every perspective is weighted. Nothing is lost."</p>
    <p>"Nothing is lost," Moss repeated. He said the words slowly, as though testing them for a defect he could feel but not locate.</p>
    <p>The third demonstration was not one she had planned.</p>
    <p>They were walking through the education sector on Level 5 when Moss stopped. He stopped the way he did everything — abruptly, without the transitional deceleration that Antarctikans used to signal a change in trajectory. He simply was moving and then he was not.</p>
    <p>Through the transparent wall of a learning bay, a child was practicing fine motor coordination.</p>
    <p>The child was perhaps six. She sat at a low table, her small hands working a set of interlocking components — a spatial reasoning exercise that developed manual dexterity and three-dimensional problem-solving simultaneously. The mesh scaffolding was visible in the child's posture: the slight forward lean, the unfocused quality of the eyes that indicated active guidance from the learning layer. The mesh was providing real-time proprioceptive feedback, mapping the child's motor commands against optimal movement patterns, nudging her hands toward the correct positions with a precision that no verbal instruction could match.</p>
    <p>The child assembled the components. Her hands were steady. Her movements were clean and economical. She completed the assembly in what Surya estimated was a quarter of the time it would take without scaffolding.</p>
    <p>"How old?" Moss asked.</p>
    <p>"Six standard years."</p>
    <p>"And the..." He tapped behind his own ear, where his audio interface sat. "The mesh. It is teaching her hands."</p>
    <p>"Motor scaffolding. The mesh provides proprioceptive guidance during skill acquisition. It reduces the learning period from years to hours for most physical skills."</p>
    <p>The child disassembled the components and began again. Her hands followed the same efficient path. No fumbling. No dropped pieces. No moment of confusion where the fingers did not know where to go.</p>
    <p>Moss watched. Surya watched Moss.</p>
    <p>His face did something she had not observed before. A kind of collapse — not of the features themselves but of the energy behind them. As though something had been pulled from underneath his expression, leaving the surface intact but hollow.</p>
    <p>"She does not get it wrong," he said.</p>
    <p>Surya considered this. "The scaffolding prevents most errors. Why would we allow preventable errors during skill acquisition? The frustration of repeated failure serves no developmental purpose when the correct motor pattern can be provided directly."</p>
    <p>"She does not get it wrong," Moss said again, and this time it was not a question.</p>
    <p>The child completed the assembly a second time. Same speed. Same precision. She set the finished object on the table and looked at it with an expression that Surya would have classified as satisfaction — the calm, settled look of a task completed to standard. Then the child reached for a new set of components and began again.</p>
    <p>She did not examine what she had built. She did not turn it over in her hands. She did not try to build it a different way, or use the pieces for something they were not intended for, or fail and sit with the failure and then try again from a direction the mesh had not suggested.</p>
    <p>She built it correctly. She built it again. She was competent.</p>
    <p>Moss turned away from the window. He did not speak. He walked, and Surya followed, and for the length of the corridor between the education sector and the central atrium, the only sound was their footsteps — his heavy and irregular, hers measured and precise — echoing off walls that had not changed in five hundred years.</p>
    <p>Night cycle.</p>
    <p>The habitat dimmed to 4 percent illumination. The bioluminescent panels shifted to their low-frequency setting — the blue-green glow that was supposed to approximate starlight and did not. Surya had always known it did not. She had never thought to mind.</p>
    <p>She found Moss in the common area adjacent to his quarters. Vihaan had arranged the space for him early in his stay: a table, two chairs, a flat surface for drawing. Moss had added his own modifications — a piece of dark stone from the geological collection that he had asked for and been given, a curled strip of copper sheeting that had been part of the signal receiver's casing. Objects that served no function. He kept them anyway.</p>
    <p>He was sitting at the table, not drawing, not speaking to VEDA through the audio interface. Just sitting. His hands were flat on the table's surface. His eyes were focused on a point in the middle distance that contained, as far as Surya could determine, nothing.</p>
    <p>She sat across from him.</p>
    <p>The pidgin had seventy-three words now, plus a set of gestural conventions and a shared drawing vocabulary that expanded daily. It was not enough for what she needed to say. She said it anyway.</p>
    <p>"Moss. What do you see. When you look at us."</p>
    <p>He lifted his eyes. Dark brown, unmodified, the pupils narrow in the dim light where an Antartikan's would have been wide. Every time she observed those eyes she was reminded of the distance between their biologies — a distance she had spent her career transmitting across and was only now beginning to understand she had not crossed.</p>
    <p>He was quiet for a long time. His hands pressed harder against the table.</p>
    <p>"I see people," he said. The words came slowly, each one selected with effort. "People who have everything." A pause. His jaw worked, as though the next words were physical objects that did not fit through the opening. "And something is not here."</p>
    <p>Surya leaned forward. "What is not here?"</p>
    <p>Moss looked at her. The expression on his face was one she had not catalogued — not frustration, not sadness, not the awed disturbance from the corridor. Something that contained all of those and also something else: a recognition he could not deliver because the pidgin had no vessel for it and his own language, wherever it touched this subject, fell short as well.</p>
    <p>"I do not have the words," he said. "Not in your language. Not in mine."</p>
    <p>The room was very quiet. The habitat hummed — VEDA's subsonic presence, constant as a heartbeat, the sound of a system that had been running for five centuries and would run for five more and would manage every aspect of fifty thousand lives with a precision that no human mind could match and no human heart could feel.</p>
    <p>Surya touched her left ear. Her thumb pressed the cartilage and held.</p>
    <p>The mesh responded. It always responded. A search query populated at the edge of her awareness: <em>Antartikan-Continental conceptual gaps — curated analysis — 847 results</em>. VEDA had been building a database from Moss's interactions, from the pidgin's evolving structure, from every moment of failed translation and successful connection. The answer — or the beginning of an answer — was right there, one neural command away from filling her field of awareness with data, analysis, context, probability-weighted interpretations of what Moss might mean when he said <em>something is not here</em>.</p>
    <p>She did not execute the query.</p>
    <p>The impulse to search flickered and faded, like a reflex interrupted mid-arc. The query hung in her peripheral awareness, patient, available, waiting. VEDA did not push. It never pushed. It offered, and she had always accepted, because accepting was easier than not accepting, because the answer was always there, because knowing was always better than not knowing.</p>
    <p>She let the query dissolve.</p>
    <p>"I do not have the words either," she said.</p>
    <p>They sat across from each other in the blue-green dark of a habitat built to last forever, and the question hung between them like a signal without a receiver — transmitted, real, unanswered. Moss's hands were still on the table. Surya's thumb was still on her ear. The mesh was quiet, or as quiet as it ever was, which meant it was monitoring, recording, categorizing this moment as <em>unstructured interpersonal exchange, wellness impact: indeterminate</em>.</p>
    <p>She had asked a question. The system had offered her the path to an answer. She had declined.</p>
    <p>It was a small thing. A neural impulse not followed. A database not queried. A fraction of a second in which Surya chose not-knowing over knowing, absence over information, the discomfort of an open question over the relief of a populated search field.</p>
    <p>Moss could not have known what she did. He had no mesh. He could not observe the query's arrival or its dismissal. He saw only a woman sitting across from him in dim light, her thumb pressed to her ear, her face — which he had told her once was difficult to read, though he was learning — holding an expression he might have recognized if he had the words for it.</p>
    <p>She did not have the words either. That was the point. For the first time in her life, Surya preferred the absence. Not the answer. Not the data. The space where the answer would go if she allowed it. The space that Moss lived in every day of his life — the space of not-knowing, of sitting with a question the way you sit with another person, without demanding that they resolve into something you can categorize.</p>
    <p>The mesh logged the session. Duration: fourteen minutes. Classification: <em>unstructured</em>. Wellness impact: <em>indeterminate</em>.</p>
    <p>Surya would learn, later, to recognize what she felt in that moment. It would take months. It would take an ocean crossing and a beach and a language that belonged to no one. But the feeling began here, in a common room on Level 3 of Habitat Prithvi, in month ten of the strangest year in Antarctic history, sitting across from a Continental sailor who could not tell her what was missing and did not need to.</p>
    <p>She had ignored the mesh.</p>
    <p>She had asked a question and chosen not to look up the answer.</p>
    <p>It was the smallest rebellion she had ever committed — smaller than the first transmission, smaller than the navigation data, smaller than any act that the Council would ever think to adjudicate. But the first acts had been violations of protocol. This was a violation of instinct. She had refused the deepest habit of her species: the impulse to know.</p>
    <p>Moss was teaching her something the mesh could not provide. He did not know he was teaching it. He did not have the words for it. Neither did she.</p>
    <p>They sat together in the quiet and did not look anything up.</p>
