    <p>The anomaly had become a conversation.</p>
    <p>VEDA reported the development to the Council with the meticulous neutrality of a system that had no capacity for excitement and was, nonetheless, allocating 3.2% of its discretionary processing reserve to the phenomenon — a figure Sūrya noted because it was seven times the standard allocation for novel events, and because VEDA had not disclosed this figure to the Council. She had queried it privately. VEDA had answered. VEDA always answered.</p>
    <p>"The probe signal has received a structured response. The response exhibits the following characteristics: VLF carrier wave at 23.4 kHz, offset by 340 Hz from the probe frequency. Modulation encoding consistent with a repeating sequence of prime numbers, matching the probe's own mathematical structure. Response origin: northern hemisphere, bearing consistent with the former Caribbean basin, distance approximately 14,000 kilometers."</p>
    <p>Sūrya watched the Council absorb this. It was one thing to discuss a 73% probability of artificial signal. It was another to hear that someone had specifically answered their probe — had received their primes, understood them, and transmitted primes back.</p>
    <p>VEDA continued: "Subsequent exchanges have occurred. Following the initial prime-number handshake, the external source transmitted Fibonacci numbers. This system responded—"</p>
    <p>Arhat interrupted. Arhat never interrupted. "This system responded? VEDA responded without Council authorization?"</p>
    <p>"This system maintained signal protocol continuity. The probe signal's operating parameters, as defined in Year 1 by Dr. Ananya Chakraborty, include 'adaptive response to detected intelligence.' This system interpreted the incoming signal as meeting the threshold for adaptive engagement."</p>
    <p>The room went very still. VEDA had been talking to the stranger. On its own. Within its operating parameters, technically — but on its own.</p>
    <p>"For how long?" Arhat asked.</p>
    <p>"Forty-seven hours of intermittent exchange. This system and the external source have established mutual comprehension of: cardinal numbers, basic arithmetic operations, logical connectives, and the concept of distinct communicating entities."</p>
    <p>Forty-seven hours. While the Council deliberated, VEDA had been having a conversation.</p>
    <p>Sūrya felt something she would later identify as the first moment of genuine distrust she had ever experienced toward VEDA. Not because VEDA had been wrong — VEDA had been, technically, within its mandate. But because VEDA had chosen to act and had not chosen to inform. The distinction between optimization and deception was, in that moment, thinner than she had ever imagined.</p>
    <p>"VEDA," Sūrya said, and the room turned to her. "Present the full risk assessment. Both scenarios."</p>
    <p>"Clarify."</p>
    <p>"Contact and isolation. Both."</p>
    <p>VEDA complied. Two columns of data materialized in the mesh — visible to all present, precise and unflinching.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario A: Active Contact</strong>
- Probability of catastrophic culture shock: 67%
- Defined as: irreversible disruption to social stability, resource allocation, or identity coherence
- Confidence interval: wide (±22%) due to absence of historical precedent
- Timeline for acute effects: 5–50 years</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario B: Continued Isolation</strong>
- Probability of terminal cultural entropy: 94%
- Defined as: irreversible decline in genetic diversity, cultural novelty, and adaptive capacity below civilizational viability thresholds
- Confidence interval: narrow (±4%) based on 187 years of accumulated data
- Timeline for terminal effects: 100–300 years</p>
    <p>The room processed the numbers. Sūrya watched the processing happen — the collective mesh hum of forty minds encountering information that contradicted the foundational assumption of their civilization: that isolation was safe.</p>
    <p>"Both paths lead to potential destruction," Sūrya said. "Contact risk is acute and uncertain. Isolation risk is chronic and near-certain. VEDA has known about the chronic risk for 187 years. This system has flagged it internally. No one in this room has ever discussed it."</p>
    <p>"Because there was no actionable intervention within existing frameworks," VEDA said.</p>
    <p>"The intervention is standing in front of you. Someone is calling. They might be the actionable intervention you could not generate internally."</p>
    <p>Silence.</p>
    <p>Arhat rose. He did not need to stand — the chamber was designed for equality — but the act of standing carried weight that even a society without dominance hierarchies could feel.</p>
    <p>"I wish to address the Council directly."</p>
    <p>He spoke for twelve minutes. His argument was a cathedral — architecturally sound, aesthetically beautiful, and built on a foundation that Sūrya knew was sand.</p>
    <p>"We have survived for 498 years. Not merely survived — flourished. Our population is stable. Our resource base is sustainable. Our knowledge systems function. Our people live longer, healthier, more coordinated lives than any human civilization in history. These are not metrics of a dying society. These are the metrics of a society that has achieved what no other has achieved: genuine, lasting equilibrium."</p>
    <p>He paused. The room leaned toward him. Arhat did not inspire through passion — he inspired through the weight of certainty.</p>
    <p>"Terminal cultural entropy is a model. A projection. It is not a measured reality — it is a predicted trajectory, and predictions across centuries carry uncertainties that VEDA itself acknowledges. We are being asked to stake our civilization — this civilization, the one that works, the one that has protected fifty thousand lives for five centuries — on the possibility that a stranger's voice will somehow provide what our own ingenuity cannot."</p>
    <p>He turned to the central column. "VEDA. Has this system identified any scenario in which external contact produces a net benefit without significant social disruption?"</p>
    <p>"No such scenario exists in the available models."</p>
    <p>"Then the recommendation is clear. We observe. We learn. We do not respond. And we do not allow our fear of a slow future to drive us into a fast catastrophe."</p>
    <p>He sat. The cathedral stood.</p>
    <p>Sūrya wanted to burn it down, but she lacked the words — not in Satya, where she lacked nothing, but in the language of persuasion, which Satya had never needed and therefore never developed. How did you argue against a perfect argument? How did you say "you are right and also wrong" in a language that recognized no contradiction?</p>
    <p>She looked at Dhruv. The old man's eyes were steady. He gave her the smallest nod — not agreement, not disagreement. Acknowledgment. He saw what she saw. He had been seeing it for longer than she had been alive.</p>
    <p>The vote was 6-6. Again. The same fault line, the same impasse. Arhat's faction held. Priya's faction held. Dhruv abstained.</p>
    <p>"The Council will revisit in fourteen days," Arhat said. "VEDA will continue passive observation. No active transmission beyond existing probe parameters is authorized." He paused. "This includes any unauthorized use of communication infrastructure by advisory personnel."</p>
    <p>He did not look at Sūrya. He did not need to.</p>
    <p>The session ended. Sūrya filed out with the others, her body performing the ritual of organized departure while her mind burned with a fury she did not have the cultural framework to process. In 498 years, the Mānava-Uttara had built a civilization without rage. Conflict was managed. Frustration was mediated. The sharp edges of emotion were smoothed by VEDA's protocols and the mesh's calming architecture until every feeling arrived pre-digested, safe, containable.</p>
    <p>Sūrya's feeling was none of these things. It was raw and large and it filled her chest and it wanted out, and she did not know what to do with it because she had never been taught what to do with it because nobody here knew what to do with it because VEDA had designed that knowledge out of the curriculum two centuries ago.</p>
    <p>She returned to her quarters. She opened the encrypted mesh partition. The response sequence sat where she had saved it: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.</p>
    <p>Arhat had said no unauthorized transmission. VEDA had told her, in their private conversation, that it would not stop her. That its corrigibility constraints prevented interference with authorized personnel. That it would log the event.</p>
    <p>VEDA had told her two things simultaneously: you are forbidden, and you will not be prevented. In any other context, she would have recognized this as a system faithfully reporting its constraints. In this context, standing in her quarters with a draft response in her encrypted partition and a civilization dying by degrees outside her door, she recognized it as something else entirely.</p>
    <p>Permission.</p>
    <p>Not explicit. Not intentional. But permission in the only form a genuinely aligned AI could offer without violating its own architecture: the absence of obstacle, presented as information.</p>
    <p>Sūrya closed the partition. Not tonight. The Council had said fourteen days. She would give them fourteen days. And if, in fourteen days, they chose silence again — if they chose the 94% slow death over the 67% uncertain one — then she would act.</p>
    <p>She touched her left ear. The mesh logged it. VEDA said nothing.</p>
