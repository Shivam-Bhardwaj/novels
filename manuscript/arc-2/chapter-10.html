  <article class="chapter-body">
    <p>The idea came to Kael on a night when the signal was clear and the mathematics had run dry.</p>
    <p>They had built a language of logic. They could express truth, quantity, relation, direction, time. They could describe physical laws with mathematical precision. They could ask questions and receive answers. But they were still blind. Every exchange was abstract — pure symbol, pure structure, pure thought. Kael had never seen what she was talking to. The entity had never seen her. They were two minds connected by mathematics and separated by the absolute barrier of unshared experience.</p>
    <p>Sight would change that.</p>
    <p>She had been thinking about it for weeks. The bandwidth was terrible — a few characters per minute on VLF — but images were just numbers arranged in a grid. If she could define a protocol — grid size, encoding scheme, pixel values — she could transmit a picture. It would be agonizingly slow. A simple image might take an entire session. But it would be a picture. Proof of form. Evidence that the mind on the other end existed in a body, in a world, in a shape.</p>
    <p>She designed the protocol over two nights: a grid of 64×64 pixels, each pixel encoded as a binary value (black or white — no grayscale, too expensive in bandwidth), transmitted row by row with start and end markers. She sent the specification and received, within one exchange, a confirmation and a counter-proposal: 128×128 pixels, with four grayscale levels. The entity's version was better. Of course it was.</p>
    <p>The first image she sent was a circle. A filled disk, white on black. Simple. Unambiguous. The most universal shape she could think of.</p>
    <p>The response was a circle of different proportions — slightly flattened, as if drawn on a different coordinate system. But recognizably a circle. The entity understood visual representation. They were sharing sight.</p>
    <p>Over the next three days, they exchanged shapes: triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon. Each confirmed that both sides could encode and decode visual information. Then Kael escalated. She sent the periodic table — not the full table, but the first twenty elements, encoded as atomic numbers arranged in the familiar grid. Hydrogen at position 1. Helium at position 2. The structure of matter, depicted.</p>
    <p>The entity sent back the same table with additional elements — heavier atoms, beyond what Kael had included. The entity knew the periodic table. The entity understood chemistry at a level that exceeded Kael's scholarly training.</p>
    <p>Kael sat before her wall of symbols and made a decision that would change the history of two worlds. She would send the image she had been preparing for weeks. The one she had drawn and redrawn, counted pixel by pixel, checked and rechecked. The image that would answer the question that had haunted her since the first Fibonacci response.</p>
    <p>She would send a picture of a human being.</p>
    <p>The image took four hours to transmit. 128×128 pixels, each one a number, each number a pulse, each pulse traveling through the waveguide at the speed of light and arriving — she hoped, she prayed in her secular way — at a receiver fourteen thousand kilometers to the south.</p>
    <p>A human body. Front view and side view, drawn with the careful precision of a lensmaker who understood proportion and anatomy from the medical texts in the scholar-house library. Limbs, torso, head, hands, feet. The proportions marked with their established number system: height, arm span, head-to-body ratio. A ruler figure, as neutral and informative as she could make it.</p>
    <p>She sent it at midnight and switched to receive mode.</p>
    <p>The response took longer than any previous exchange. Twenty-three minutes — not the usual eleven to fourteen. Kael sat in the dark and felt each minute as a small eternity, her heart doing something arrhythmic and unhelpful.</p>
    <p>When the response arrived, she decoded it pixel by pixel, line by line, filling in her own grid on paper with a steadiness that her hands did not feel.</p>
    <p>A body diagram. Human. Front view and side view.</p>
    <p>But different.</p>
    <p>The proportions were wrong. The figure was shorter — not dramatically, but measurably, the height-to-arm-span ratio compressed. The head was slightly larger in proportion to the body. The eyes — rendered as simple shapes in the crude resolution — were larger. The limbs were shorter, the torso stockier.</p>
    <p>Kael stared at the image. It was human. Unmistakably human. Two arms, two legs, one head, bilateral symmetry, upright posture. But it was human the way a cousin is human — recognizably the same species, visibly shaped by a different set of pressures.</p>
    <p>She reached for the next frame. The entity had sent a second image, appended to the first.</p>
    <p>The double helix.</p>
    <p>DNA. The familiar twisted ladder that the old texts depicted, that every glass-eye in Tidemouth recognized from the fragments of biology preserved in the scholar-house. The entity had drawn it with a precision that made Kael's own diagrams look like cave paintings — each nucleotide pair depicted, the sugar-phosphate backbone rendered in clean lines.</p>
    <p>But this DNA diagram had annotations. Sequences highlighted. Markers she didn't recognize — not the natural base pairs she'd studied, but something else. Insertions. Modifications. Edits.</p>
    <p>This DNA had been changed. Deliberately.</p>
    <p>Kael sat on the concrete floor and held the paper in hands that had stopped shaking because the shaking had been replaced by something deeper and more still — the complete cessation of motion that comes when the mind encounters a fact too large for the body's usual repertoire of responses.</p>
    <p>They were human. The entity — the person — the people — on the other end of the signal were human. The same species. The same DNA. The same double helix, the same four-letter code, the same fundamental biology.</p>
    <p>But they had rewritten their own genome. They had edited themselves. Changed their proportions, altered their eyes, modified their metabolism. They had done something to their own DNA that the Continentals could not imagine because the Continentals had lost the technology to imagine it.</p>
    <p>They were human. And they were not the same kind of human.</p>
    <hr class="scene-break">
    <p>Sūrya decoded the image in the communications laboratory with three other signal team members looking over her shoulder. Lakshya had arranged the session under the cover of "ongoing passive monitoring" — a classification that technically permitted observation without active Council authorization.</p>
    <p>The image resolved line by line on the laboratory display. A body. Human. The proportions were wrong.</p>
    <p>The figure was tall — taller than any Antartikan. Broader in the shoulders, heavier in the limbs. The head was proportionally smaller. The eyes were smaller. The body plan was recognizably <em>Homo sapiens</em> but shaped by a different set of assumptions about what a body should be: larger, stronger, built for an environment that required physical endurance.</p>
    <p>Sūrya stared at the image and felt a sensation she later realized was vertigo — not physical but conceptual. She was looking at what humans used to be. Before the modifications. Before the genetic program. Before VEDA's careful calibrations and the colony's deliberate reshaping of its own species. She was looking at the <em>before</em>.</p>
    <p>"They are unmodified," said Dr. Ashwin, the team's geneticist, in a voice that contained no inflection because his emotional processing was fully occupied by the implications.</p>
    <p>"Baseline human," said Lakshya. "Standard <em>Homo sapiens</em>. No germline edits. No metabolic optimization. No sensory enhancement."</p>
    <p>"They are what we were," Sūrya said.</p>
    <p>The room was silent. Four people, connected by a mesh that would normally smooth this kind of cognitive disruption into manageable categories, stared at an image of a human body that looked like a memory of something they had forgotten they'd lost.</p>
    <p>Sūrya transmitted their response: the Antarctic body diagram, proportioned to their specifications, annotated with their standard genetic markers. And the DNA diagram — the full double helix with modifications highlighted. She did not hide what they were. She did not soften the edits. She sent the truth, because Satya meant truth, and because the moment demanded it.</p>
    <p>The laboratory was quiet for a long time after the transmission.</p>
    <p>Dr. Ashwin broke the silence. "They will not understand the genetic annotations. They do not have the technology to read them."</p>
    <p>"They will understand enough," Sūrya said. "They will see that the DNA is modified. They will see that we changed ourselves. They do not need to understand the specific edits to understand the implication."</p>
    <p>"And what is the implication?"</p>
    <p>Sūrya looked at the two images side by side. The Continental body — tall, broad, unmodified. The Antarctic body — shorter, paler, engineered. Five hundred years ago, these had been the same. The same DNA, the same proportions, the same species, standing under the same sky. Now they were divergent. Not enough to be different species — not nearly enough for that — but enough to be visible. Enough to be strange. Enough to raise the question that the novel would spend its remaining chapters trying to answer.</p>
    <p>"The implication," Sūrya said, "is that we need to decide who we are going to be when we meet them."</p>
    <p>"If we meet them."</p>
    <p>"When." Sūrya touched her left ear. The mesh logged the gesture. "This changes everything. They are not aliens. They are not machines. They are us. They are what we used to be. And we are what they might have become, if the world had been different. The question is no longer whether to make contact. The question is what kind of contact. Because when you discover that the stranger calling to you from across the darkness is your own reflection in a mirror you forgot existed — the conversation you have next determines everything."</p>
    <p>She looked at the images one more time. Two bodies. One species. Two answers to the question of how to be human. And between them, an ocean that killed everyone who tried to cross it, and a signal made of mathematics and hope, and five hundred years of silence that had just shattered into the most dangerous sound in history.</p>
    <p>Someone was going to have to cross that ocean. Not in radio waves. Not in mathematics. In a ship, in a body, in the terrifying flesh-and-blood reality of one human standing in front of another and trying to say: <em>We are the same. We are different. Can we live with both?</em></p>
    <p>Sūrya did not know who would make that crossing. She did not know that, months from now, she would make it herself — in reverse, carrying the question back across the water to the people who had first dared to ask it.</p>
    <p>She knew only this: the silence was over. The question was spoken. And no one on either side of the ocean would ever be the same.</p>
