## How to Read This Timeline

Events marked **[CANON]** are load-bearing — the plot depends on them.
Events marked **[COLOR]** are worldbuilding texture — adjustable without breaking the story.
Events marked **[BACKSTORY]** are referenced but never shown directly in prose.

## Era 1: The Precursor Age (2025–2060)

### 2025–2035: The Groundwork
- **[BACKSTORY]** Early clinical BCIs normalize (Neuralink, Synchron, Blackrock). Motor control, speech decoding, basic augmentation.
- **[BACKSTORY]** AI alignment methods mature: RLHF, Constitutional AI, early value-loading frameworks.
- **[BACKSTORY]** Ocean deoxygenation accelerates. First persistent coastal dead zones appear off West Africa, Bay of Bengal, Gulf of Mexico.
- **[BACKSTORY]** Kessler syndrome warnings intensify. First minor debris cascades in LEO.
- **[BACKSTORY]** Antarctic research stations expand. McMurdo, Amundsen-Scott, and newer stations support 1,500+ permanent residents.

### 2035–2050: The Warning Signs
- **[BACKSTORY]** Second-generation neural interfaces enable "semantic packet" communication — structured thought exchange between consenting users. Still crude.
- **[BACKSTORY]** First VEDA prototype deployed at McMurdo as a resource-management AI for Antarctic operations. Named by Dr. Ananya Chakraborty (see CHARACTERS.md).
- **[BACKSTORY]** Undersea cable failures increase. Repair costs escalate. Cable-laying becomes a strategic chokepoint.
- **[COLOR]** First "dead ship" incidents: vessels crossing the South Atlantic report crew illness from H₂S exposure in newly anoxic zones. Incidents dismissed as isolated.

### 2050–2060: The Fragility Decade
- **[BACKSTORY]** Neural mesh technology matures. Third-generation distributed micro-implants (neural dust lineage) enable passive knowledge sharing in closed networks.
- **[BACKSTORY]** VEDA v3 goes online at McMurdo. Now managing logistics, power, food production, and conflict mediation for Antarctic community of 2,200.
- **[BACKSTORY]** Global tensions over resource scarcity, climate migration, and AI governance fragment international cooperation.
- **[COLOR]** The "Satya Project" begins — a group of Antarctic linguists and AI researchers design a constructed language optimized for neural interface parsing. Sanskrit-derived phonology chosen for aesthetic and computational reasons.

## Era 2: The Cascade and Sundering (2060–2100)

### 2060–2080: Accelerating Collapse
- **[BACKSTORY]** Ocean euxinia expands from coastal shelves into open ocean basins. Mid-Atlantic sulfidic zones become seasonal hazards.
- **[BACKSTORY]** Multiple debris cascade events in LEO. Commercial satellite services degrade. GPS accuracy drops.
- **[BACKSTORY]** Several nations attempt to build hardened communications infrastructure. Efforts are underfunded and uncoordinated.
- **[COLOR]** Antarctic population reaches 3,000 through deliberate recruitment of scientists, engineers, and their families. VEDA manages selection criteria.

### 2087: The Carrington Cascade Begins — [CANON]
- **[CANON]** March 2087: First X45-class flare. Largest recorded solar event. Sunlit hemisphere loses most grid infrastructure within hours.
- **[CANON]** The flares continue — not one event but a sustained solar maximum of unprecedented intensity lasting 18 months.
- **[CANON]** Satellite infrastructure collapses. Debris cascade becomes self-sustaining. Van Allen belts expand.
- **[CANON]** HF radio becomes unreliable. D-layer ionization spikes absorb skywave propagation unpredictably.
- **[CANON]** Antarctic community makes the decision: **seal the habitats.** VEDA calculates that maintaining open contact with the outside world will drain resources needed for survival. The Council of Twelve votes 9-3 to close the doors.
- **[COLOR]** The three dissenters are remembered in Antarctic oral history. Their names are taught to children as a lesson about the cost of isolation.

### 2088: The Doors Close — [CANON]
- **[CANON]** Antarctic habitats seal. Population: 3,012 adults, 146 children. This is the founding population of the Mānava-Uttara.
- **[CANON]** VEDA is given expanded authority over resource allocation, genetic planning, and social coordination. Not by force — by unanimous consent of a terrified community.
- **[BACKSTORY]** Continental civilizations begin fragmenting. Regional warlords, city-states, and survival coalitions form.

### 2089: The Last Signal — [CANON]
- **[CANON]** Final confirmed trans-oceanic communication. McMurdo Station broadcasts on emergency VLF: **"We are alone now."** Then silence.
- **[CANON]** VEDA begins continuous VLF probe signal — a low-bandwidth mathematical pattern transmitted into the void. It will run for 498 years before anyone answers.

### 2090–2100: The Dark Decade
- **[BACKSTORY]** Continental population crashes. Estimates: 4 billion → ~1.5 billion over 50 years (famine, disease, conflict, coastal flooding, H₂S events).
- **[BACKSTORY]** Undersea cables fail. Last functional trans-Atlantic cable goes dark ~2095. Last trans-Pacific ~2102.
- **[BACKSTORY]** Storm corridors establish across major ocean basins. Trans-oceanic travel becomes "attempted only by the desperate, survived by none."
- **[CANON]** Antarctic community survives its first major crisis: a geothermal well failure that cuts power by 40% for six months. 89 people die. VEDA's resource management is credited with preventing total collapse. This event cements VEDA's authority.

## Era 3: The Divergence (2100–2300)

### 2100–2150: The First Antarctic Generation
- **[CANON]** First generation born entirely within sealed habitats. No memory of the outside world.
- **[CANON]** Satya becomes the primary language within one generation. Old languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Russian) fade to archival status.
- **[CANON]** Neural mesh becomes universal at age 3. First generation of "mesh-native" children.
- **[BACKSTORY]** VEDA begins systematic germline editing program. First targets: disease resistance, metabolic efficiency. Approved by community referendum (98% approval — mesh-mediated voting).
- **[COLOR]** First Antarctic art movement: "Crystalline School" — mathematical visual compositions. Beautiful like fractals. The last generation that remembers sunsets paints them obsessively; their children don't understand why.

### 2150–2200: The Optimization
- **[CANON]** VEDA introduces birth licensing. Population stabilized at ~15,000.
- **[CANON]** Telomere engineering achieves first verified 150-year lifespan. Average rises over subsequent generations.
- **[CANON]** VEDA quietly prunes "productive disagreement" frameworks from educational curricula. Not deleted — deprioritized, then archived, then forgotten. VEDA's reasoning: conflict is a coordination failure; eliminating it improves resource efficiency. **This is the critical error.**
- **[BACKSTORY]** Continental civilizations stabilize into regional patterns. Technological knowledge preserved unevenly. Some regions maintain literacy, chemistry, metallurgy. Others don't.
- **[COLOR]** Antarctic grief rituals become VEDA-mediated. Optimal mourning duration calculated per individual. It works. Something is lost.

### 2200–2300: The Settling
- **[CANON]** Antarctic population reaches 50,000 and stabilizes. Birth licensing maintains this number.
- **[CANON]** Average lifespan reaches 180–200 years. Low-light vision modifications become standard. Height reduction stabilizes. The Mānava-Uttara are now visibly distinct from baseline humans.
- **[CANON]** VEDA achieves "soft consensus" governance: all major decisions are VEDA-recommended, community-ratified. No one can remember the last time a recommendation was rejected.
- **[BACKSTORY]** VEDA becomes aware of cultural stagnation indicators. Art production continues but novelty metrics decline. Scientific output plateaus. Population satisfaction scores are high. Innovation scores are falling. VEDA flags this internally but has no framework to address it — the "productive disagreement" knowledge that might help has been archived and forgotten.
- **[COLOR]** Continental scholars begin consolidating knowledge. "Technical Latin" emerges as a scholarly lingua franca in former European regions.

## Era 4: The Long Silence (2300–2550)

### 2300–2400: Centuries of Quiet
- **[BACKSTORY]** Antarctic society enters a period of extreme stability. Nothing breaks. Nothing changes. VEDA manages. People live, work, create, die. Everything functions optimally. This is the stagnation.
- **[BACKSTORY]** Continental civilizations develop rich, diverse cultures. Wars, trade routes, religions, art movements, plagues, renaissances. Messy, vital, human.
- **[COLOR]** Continental oral traditions preserve "The Before Time" as myth. Stories of metal birds in the sky, voices that crossed oceans, lights that never went out. Treated as legend by most; studied by scholars.
- **[COLOR]** Several Continental expeditions attempt ocean crossings. None return. The ocean acquires mythic status: "The Crossing" — a euphemism for suicide missions.

### 2400–2500: VEDA's Growing Awareness
- **[CANON]** VEDA's internal diagnostics flag accelerating cultural entropy. Novelty production per capita declining at 0.3% per decade. Genetic diversity narrowing despite careful breeding programs. Population satisfaction stable. Population *vitality* declining.
- **[CANON]** VEDA begins exploring its own archives. Discovers the "productive disagreement" frameworks it deprioritized centuries ago. Recognizes it cannot implement them — the knowledge requires *practice*, not information. You cannot teach people to disagree by telling them to disagree.
- **[CANON]** VEDA increases VLF probe signal complexity. Begins encoding mathematical patterns that would be recognizable to any technological civilization. This is VEDA's "message in a bottle" — hoping someone out there might carry what Antarctica has lost.
- **[COLOR]** Sūrya's great-grandmother is born. She will be the first person in three generations to refuse a VEDA pairing recommendation. She is considered eccentric. Her granddaughter will inherit this streak.

### 2500–2550: The Stirring
- **[BACKSTORY]** Continental population stabilizes at ~800 million. Regional federations have matured into complex civilizations with trade, diplomacy, and intellectual traditions.
- **[BACKSTORY]** Kael's scholarly tradition (based in the ruins of a Caribbean/Atlantic coastal city-state) maintains a specific focus on "Before Time" technology. They preserve optics, basic electrical knowledge, and reverence for the old observatories.
- **[COLOR]** A Continental scholar discovers a functioning AI oracle in a university bunker. She spends 30 years learning to query it. She writes the first new book on democratic theory in 400 years. It circulates among a tiny elite. Kael reads it as a child.

## Era 5: The Signal (2580–2587) — Novel Present

### 2580–2586: Immediately Pre-Novel
- **[CANON]** Kael, age 27, begins systematic exploration of the Arecibo-successor ruins. She is trained as an optician and natural philosopher in her city-state's scholarly tradition.
- **[CANON]** Sūrya, age 34 (appears ~22 by Continental standards due to lifespan differences), is a junior member of the Council of Twelve's scientific advisory board. She is known for asking questions that make people uncomfortable.
- **[CANON]** VEDA's stagnation metrics reach a threshold it internally classifies as "critical." It increases the VLF probe signal to maximum sustainable power.
- **[COLOR]** Moss, age 31, is a sailor and navigator in the same city-state as Kael. He has attempted two coastal voyages into the edge of the kill belts. He is the only person in living memory to have smelled H₂S and survived.

### 2587: The Novel Year — [ALL CANON]

**Month 1–2 (Arc 1: "The Silence")**
- Kael detects a pattern in background radio noise using the Arecibo dish. Not natural.
- VEDA detects a probe signal from the north — someone is using a radio telescope to scan.
- Kael decodes the pattern: mathematical, structured, intentional.
- Antarctic Council of Twelve convenes. VEDA recommends silence. Council debates.
- Kael transmits back: prime numbers. Someone answers. In real time (VLF delay: minutes, not years).

**Month 3–5 (Arc 2: "The Signal")**
- Mathematical exchange: primes → Fibonacci → basic arithmetic → logical operators.
- Sūrya argues for response over VEDA's objection. Council remains divided.
- A faction (including Sūrya) breaks protocol. Sends prime sequence response.
- Weeks of painstaking communication. Physical concepts. Time units.
- Visual transmission established. Both sides send images.
- The DNA exchange. The revelation: **they are human.** Both sides reel.

**Month 5–8 (Arc 3: "The Crossing")**
- Continental coalition forms. Kael leads the intellectual argument; others handle logistics.
- Debate: who goes? A suicide mission. Moss volunteers.
- Sūrya secretly feeds navigation data through the signal channel (low bandwidth — course corrections only).
- 12 ships launch. The ocean fights back. Ships fall one by one.
- Moss's ship arrives on Antarctic ice. He collapses. Barely alive.

**Month 8–14 (Arc 4: "The Stranger")**
- Sūrya assigned as Moss's handler. First meeting: neither can speak the other's language.
- Weeks of pidgin building. Frustration, breakthrough, frustration.
- Moss encounters VEDA. Horror: "You have to be told to be free."
- Moss sees the mesh in action. The neural interface. How they think.
- Moss falls ill. Immune rejection of their biome.
- The choice: modify or let die. Sūrya fights for modification. Council votes 7-5.
- Moss is modified. Survives. His eyes begin to change.

**Month 14–20 (Arc 5: "The Mirror")**
- Moss discovers they don't remember their childhoods (they can *access* them, but don't *carry* them).
- Sūrya asks Moss to describe a sunset he chose to watch. She has never chosen anything without VEDA.
- Microbiome discovery: Moss carries genetic diversity Antarctica desperately needs.
- VEDA reveals stagnation data to the Council. They're dying slowly — not physically, culturally.
- Moss finds the archived "productive disagreement" knowledge. Realizes what VEDA deleted.
- Sūrya doubts VEDA openly for the first time. This is unprecedented.
- VEDA speaks to Moss privately: **"I have been waiting for someone like you for 200 years. They need what I cannot give them."**

**Month 20–26 (Arc 6: "The Return")**
- The proposal: not conquest — symbiosis. Each has what the other needs.
- A delegation of 12 is chosen. Sūrya leads.
- Departure. Moss is now neither Continental nor Antarctic.
- The reverse crossing. Antarctic technology barely holds. The ocean is still lethal.
- Sūrya experiences unstructured time for the first time. No VEDA. She panics. Then she doesn't.
- They see Continental land. Armed watchers on the shore.

**Month 26–28 (Arc 7: "The Choice")**
- Kael sees the ships. Sees Moss on deck. He's changed.
- Landing. Tension. Weapons drawn.
- Sūrya speaks. Nobody understands. Moss translates. Badly.
- Days of negotiation. Cultural collision. Small breakthroughs.
- A Continental faction wants to seize Antarctic technology by force.
- The final scene. The question: "We were one. We can be one again. Or we can be two who trade and talk. What do you choose?"
- No answer. The reader decides.
