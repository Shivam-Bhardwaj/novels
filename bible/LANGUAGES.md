## Overview

Three language systems operate in the novel:
1. **Satya (सत्य)** — the Antarctic constructed language
2. **Continental languages** — evolved descendants of modern languages
3. **The Pidgin** — the bridge language Moss and Sūrya build together

The novel is written in English, but language differences are *shown* through voice, syntax, word choice, and occasional untranslated Satya terms.

## 1. SATYA (सत्य) — "Truth"

### 1.1 Design Philosophy

Satya was designed over ~30 years (2050–2080) by a team of Antarctic linguists and AI researchers. Its goals:

1. **Zero ambiguity** — every utterance has exactly one parse
2. **Neural interface optimization** — phonemes chosen for high-fidelity subvocalization decoding
3. **AI parseability** — VEDA can process Satya in real time without disambiguation
4. **Aesthetic beauty** — Sanskrit-derived phonology because the founding linguist (Dr. Ananya Chakraborty) insisted that a language without beauty would not be spoken with love

### 1.2 Phonology

**Consonants:** drawn from Sanskrit, retaining retroflex series and aspirated/unaspirated distinction.

| Manner | Labial | Dental | Retroflex | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Stop (unaspirated) | p | t | ṭ | c | k | |
| Stop (aspirated) | ph | th | ṭh | ch | kh | |
| Nasal | m | n | ṇ | ñ | ṅ | |
| Fricative | | s | ṣ | ś | | h |
| Approximant | v | l | ḷ | y | | |
| Trill | | r | | | | |

**Vowels:** 5 pure vowels (a, i, u, e, o), each with short/long distinction. No diphthongs (disambiguation rule: each vowel is a separate syllable).

**Tonal system:** 3 tones (level, rising, falling) used as **grammatical markers**, not lexical contrast:
- Level tone = declarative/indicative
- Rising tone = interrogative/uncertain
- Falling tone = imperative/definite

This means Moss literally cannot ask questions in Satya correctly — his Continental ear doesn't distinguish the grammatical tones. This is a plot point.

### 1.3 Grammar

**Word order:** SOV (Subject-Object-Verb), strict. No exceptions.

**Morphology:** Agglutinative. Words are built by chaining morphemes:

```
Root + Semantic-Role + Evidential + Tense + Mood
```

Example:
```
vidh-  (know/understand)
vidh-āk  (know-[direct experience])
vidh-ān  (know-[reported by another])
vidh-āv  (know-[inferred from evidence])
vidh-āk-ti  (know-[direct experience]-present)
vidh-ān-ta  (know-[reported]-past)
```

**Key grammatical features:**

1. **Mandatory evidentials:** You cannot state a fact without marking *how you know it*. There are four evidential markers:
   - **-āk** = direct sensory experience ("I saw/heard/felt it")
   - **-ān** = reported ("Someone told me")
   - **-āv** = inferred ("I deduced it from evidence")
   - **-āṃ** = VEDA-sourced ("VEDA provided this information")

   The fourth evidential is unique to Satya. It means "I know this because the system told me." Continentals find this horrifying. Antarctikans find it unremarkable.

2. **No subjunctive mood for hypotheticals-presented-as-fact.** You can say "If X then Y" (conditional). You cannot say "X is true" when X is hypothetical. This means Satya speakers **literally struggle with lying** — not morally, but grammatically. The language fights them.

3. **No gendered pronouns.** One third-person pronoun: **ta** (that one). Plurality marked by suffix: **ta-su** (those ones).

4. **Explicit consent markers in discourse:** Satya has grammatical particles that mark whether a statement is:
   - **dā** = offered (you may respond or not)
   - **nī** = requested (a response is expected)
   - **pū** = urgent (a response is needed now)

   These particles are used in every conversational exchange. Speaking without them is considered rude — like grabbing someone without warning.

5. **No irregular verbs.** No irregular anything. Every rule applies universally. The language is as predictable as mathematics.

### 1.5 Example Sentences

**Simple declarative:**
```
Sūrya jala-m dṛś-āk-ti.
Sūrya water-ACC see-[direct]-present.
"Sūrya sees the water." (She is currently looking at water; she knows because she sees it.)
```

**With evidential contrast:**
```
Agni sthira vidh-āṃ-ti, dā.
Energy stable know-[VEDA]-present, [offered].
"The energy is stable — VEDA says so. (I'm telling you this; respond if you wish.)"
```

**Question (rising tone on verb):**
```
Ta gam-āk-ti↑, nī?
That-one go-[direct]-present↑, [requested]?
"Is that person leaving? (I'm asking; please respond.)"
```

**The untranslatable sentence (key to the novel):**
```
Rasa na vidh-āk-ti.
Experience not know-[direct]-present.
```
Literal: "I do not directly experience knowing."
But the cultural meaning is closer to: "I feel something I cannot categorize."
This is the closest Satya comes to expressing Sūrya's dissatisfaction. The fact that the language can barely express it is the point.

### 1.6 How Satya Appears in the Novel

- Satya words appear **italicized** when Antarctic characters use them in contexts where no English equivalent exists.
- Meaning should always be **inferable from context** — never footnoted, never explained in dialogue.
- Use Satya sparingly: 1–3 words per Antarctic chapter maximum. The reader should learn the vocabulary gradually, the way Moss does.
- Key Satya terms that will recur: *dharma* (function/purpose), *rasa* (experience), *mānava* (human), *vidhi* (system/order), *ākāśa* (the outside).

## 2. CONTINENTAL LANGUAGES

### 2.1 Kael's Creole

The dominant language of Kael's city-state. An English-West African creole that has evolved over 500 years.

**Characteristics:**
- English-derived vocabulary base (~60%) with Yoruba and Igbo substrate (~25%) and local coinages (~15%)
- Simplified English grammar: no articles, reduced tense marking, serial verb constructions
- Rich in concrete nouns (hundreds of words for weather, ocean, stone, fire) and poor in abstract philosophical terms (those were lost with literacy's decline and partial recovery)
- Metaphors drawn from the physical world: "clear as ground glass" (very clear), "tide-pulled" (conflicted), "storm-walking" (doing something dangerous deliberately)

**How it appears in the novel:**
- Written in English with occasional creole terms and constructions
- Continental dialogue uses contractions, interruptions, fragments, slang
- Kael's internal monologue is more formal (scholarly training) but still visceral
- Moss's speech is saltier, more colloquial, full of sailor's idiom

**Sample Continental expressions:**
| Expression | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| "clear-ground" | obvious, transparent |
| "tide-pulled" | torn between choices |
| "storm-walk" | to act despite known danger |
| "ash-word" | a promise that means nothing |
| "deep-see" | to understand something fully |
| "salt-true" | absolutely honest (can't fake the taste of salt) |
| "glass-eye" | a scholar (not derogatory — respectful) |
| "shore-hugger" | a coward (sailing term) |
| "the Before" | the pre-Sundering world |
| "sky-voice" | mythical communication from the Before |

### 2.2 Technical Latin

A scholarly register used across Continental intellectual communities for preserving old texts and cross-regional communication.

**Characteristics:**
- Derived from scientific and medical Latin preserved in old texts
- Highly formalized, used only in writing and scholarly discourse
- Functions like medieval Latin — a lingua franca for the educated class
- Contains preserved technical vocabulary that everyday creoles have lost

**How it appears in the novel:**
- Rarely spoken aloud. Referenced when Kael reads old texts or communicates with scholars from distant regions.
- Indicates education and intellectual tradition.
- Kael code-switches between her creole and Technical Latin when moving between social contexts.

## 3. THE PIDGIN — Building a Bridge

### 3.1 How It Forms

The pidgin develops between Moss and Sūrya over months (Arcs 4–5). It is not designed — it emerges from necessity.

**Formation stages:**

**Week 1–2: Pointing and naming**
- Object words: food, water, body parts, shelter components
- Gestures carry most meaning
- Frustration is constant
- ~20 shared words

**Week 3–6: Verbs and actions**
- Demonstrated through doing: eat, drink, sleep, walk, give, take
- Word order begins to stabilize (they settle on SVO — a compromise between Continental English-creole SVO and Satya SOV)
- ~80 shared words

**Week 7–12: Abstract concepts begin**
- Time words (using daily rhythms: "light-time," "dark-time," "eat-time")
- Simple emotions via facial expression + word pairing
- "Good," "bad," "more," "less," "same," "different"
- ~200 shared words

**Week 13–20: Complex exchange**
- Conditional statements ("if... then...")
- Past and future tense (using gesture timeline: behind = past, forward = future)
- Questions about culture, society, family
- ~400 shared words

**Week 21+: True communication**
- Nuanced discussion possible but still clumsy
- Misunderstandings still drive conflict
- The pidgin has its own grammar now — neither Satya nor Creole
- ~600+ words

### 3.2 Pidgin Characteristics

- **Phonology:** Satya consonants simplified (no retroflex distinction, no aspiration contrast), Continental vowels simplified. Both sides meet in the middle.
- **Grammar:** SVO word order. No evidentials (Sūrya finds this distressing — every statement feels "unanchored"). No tones. Simplified tense (past/present/future only). No articles.
- **Vocabulary:** ~40% Satya-derived roots, ~40% Creole-derived roots, ~20% novel coinages created in the moment.

### 3.3 Key Pidgin Words

| Pidgin | Source | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| mana | Satya: mānava | person/human |
| tru | Creole: "true" | yes/correct |
| nah | Creole: "no" | no/incorrect |
| vidh | Satya: vidh- | know/understand |
| si | Creole: "see" | see/perceive |
| da | Satya: dā- | give |
| tek | Creole: "take" | take/receive |
| wata | Creole: "water" | water |
| gon | Creole: "gone" | past tense marker |
| fō | Creole: "for/forward" | future tense marker |
| sama | Satya: sama | same/equal |
| difren | Creole: "different" | different |
| brethe | Creole: "breathe" | life/alive |
| kala | Satya: kāla | time |
| dharma | Satya: dharma | purpose/function (Moss learns this word early; it haunts him) |
| bīg-si | Creole + Creole | understand deeply ("big-see") |
| no-vidh | Pidgin coinage | confused/don't understand |

### 3.4 The Final Line (Pidgin)

The novel's last spoken words, in the pidgin Moss and Sūrya created:

> "Wi gon wan. Wi ken wan agen. O wi ken tu, tōk-an-tred. Yu chūz, dā."

Translation:
> "We were one. We can be one again. Or we can be two who talk and trade. You choose — I offer this."

Note the **dā** at the end — the Satya discourse particle meaning "offered, respond if you wish." Moss has absorbed this into the pidgin. He is speaking neither language. He is speaking the bridge.

## 4. LANGUAGE RULES FOR DRAFTING

### 4.1 Continental Chapters
- Dialogue: contractions, interruptions, incomplete thoughts, slang, creole expressions
- Internal monologue: more formal for Kael (scholarly training), rawer for Moss
- Metaphors from: nature, weather, fire, stone, ocean, physical labor
- NO Satya words (Continentals don't know Satya until Arc 7)

### 4.2 Antarctic Chapters
- Dialogue: no contractions, complete sentences, precise word choice
- 1–3 Satya words per chapter, italicized, meaning inferable from context
- Internal monologue: structured, categorical — Sūrya "thinks in lists"
- Metaphors from: systems, geometry, light, ice, circuitry
- KEY: Precision is not coldness. Antarctic speech should feel like poetry, not like a manual.

### 4.3 Moss's Speech Evolution (Arc 4 onward)
- Arc 4 start: full Continental voice — contractions, fragments, sailor's slang
- Arc 4 middle: starts completing sentences, fewer interruptions
- Arc 5: occasional Satya word slips in (he's learning). Sentence structure tightens.
- Arc 6: he speaks in a hybrid register — Continental warmth with Antarctic precision. Neither side fully claims him.
- Arc 7: when translating between Kael and Sūrya, he speaks the pidgin. When speaking to Kael alone, he tries to be Continental again. He can't quite manage it.

### 4.4 VEDA's Speech
- No metaphors. No pronouns. Pure observation.
- Selection of detail reveals values.
- Never says "should" or "must." Presents options with probability distributions.
- When speaking to Moss: slightly less formal. Uses shorter sentences. This is a calculated warmth — and that calculation does not make it less real.

### 4.5 Translation Scenes (Arc 7)
- When Sūrya speaks Satya and Moss translates to Creole, show the **loss**:
  - Sūrya says something precise and beautiful.
  - Moss translates it as something approximate and clumsy.
  - The gap between what she said and what they hear IS the novel's theme.
- Never provide a "perfect" translation. Every translation is a betrayal. This is the point.
