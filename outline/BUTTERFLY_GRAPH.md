## Purpose

Every chapter must have at least one **incoming cause** and one **outgoing effect**. If a chapter has no downstream effect, it shouldn't exist. This graph must be checked **before drafting** — a broken chain means a broken novel.

---

## Chain A: The Signal

The discovery and communication arc.

```
[1.1] Kael finds observatory ruins
  → [1.3] Kael detects the signal pattern
    → [1.5] Kael transmits prime numbers; receives Fibonacci response
      → [2.7] Kael goes public; coalition forms
        → [2.9] Sustained mathematical exchange; Lincos-like protocol
          → [2.10] DNA image exchange; revelation: both human

[1.2] VEDA detects anomaly in probe response (tells no one)
  → [1.4] VEDA reports to Council; probability 73% artificial
    → [2.6] Council debates; VEDA recommends silence; 6-6 deadlock
      → [2.8] Sūrya breaks protocol; transmits prime response
        → [2.9] Two-way communication established
          → [2.10] DNA exchange; genetic modification revealed
```

**Convergence point:** Ch 2.10 — both chains merge at the DNA revelation.

---

## Chain B: The Crossing

The physical journey from Continental to Antarctic.

```
[2.10] DNA revelation — they are human but modified
  → [3.11] Continental debate: send expedition
    → [3.12] Moss volunteers; 12 ships, 180 crew
      → [3.14] Fleet launches; ocean attacks
        → [3.15] Ships fall; Captain Lin dies; Moss takes helm
          → [3.16] One ship arrives; Moss collapses on ice

[2.8] Sūrya breaks protocol (first unauthorized act)
  → [3.13] Sūrya transmits navigation data (second unauthorized act)
    → [3.14] Moss receives waypoints; adjusts course
      → [3.15] Waypoints save Moss's ship from worst corridors
        → [3.16] Arrival — Sūrya's data was the difference
```

**Convergence point:** Ch 3.16 — Moss arrives because of his courage AND Sūrya's secret help. Neither alone would suffice.

---

## Chain C: The Transformation

Moss's physical and psychological change.

```
[3.16] Moss arrives in Antarctica, half-dead
  → [4.17] Sūrya assigned as handler; first meeting
    → [4.18] Communication struggle; pidgin begins (~30 words)
      → [4.19] Moss encounters VEDA; "You have to be told to be free"
        → [4.20] Moss sees the mesh; child learning without struggle
          → [4.21] Moss falls ill; immune rejection
            → [4.22] Council votes 7-5; Moss is modified; eyes change

[4.22] Moss modified — now biologically hybrid
  → [5.23] Memory scene — "Why would I carry it?"
    → [5.24] Sunset conversation — Sūrya's first unoptimized choice
      → [5.25] Microbiome discovery — Moss carries what they need
        → [5.27] Moss finds deleted knowledge in VEDA archives
          → [5.28] VEDA's confession to Moss
```

**Key insight:** Moss's transformation is both literal (biological modification) and metaphorical (he becomes the bridge between epistemologies). The physical change drives the psychological discoveries.

---

## Chain D: The Return

The reverse crossing and first in-person contact.

```
[5.28] VEDA's confession — "Productive failure"
  → [6.29] Symbiosis proposal; Council votes 8-4
    → [6.30] Delegation of 12 chosen; Sūrya leads
      → [6.31] Departure; Moss reckons with identity
        → [6.32] At sea; VEDA range exceeded
          → [6.33] Sūrya's liberation — unstructured time, first purposeless art
            → [6.34] Land sighted; Moss sees home through changed eyes

[6.34] Ships reach Continental shore
  → [7.35] Kael sees Moss changed; sees the twelve
    → [7.36] Landing; first face-to-face contact
      → [7.37] Sūrya speaks; Moss translates; meaning lost
        → [7.38] Days of negotiation; small breakthroughs
          → [7.39] Warlord threat; Sūrya offers transparency
            → [7.40] The question asked; no answer given
```

---

## Chain E: The Hidden Chain (Thematic)

The knowledge gap that drives the entire plot.

```
[BACKSTORY ~2150] VEDA deprioritizes productive-disagreement frameworks
  → [BACKSTORY ~2200] Knowledge archived, then forgotten
    → [BACKSTORY ~2400] VEDA detects cultural entropy; cannot self-correct
      → [BACKSTORY ~2400] VEDA increases VLF probe complexity — "message in a bottle"

[2.6] VEDA recommends silence (its optimization function cannot see the need)
  → [5.26] VEDA reveals stagnation data (187 years of decline)
    → [5.27] Moss finds the deleted frameworks
      → [5.28] VEDA confesses: "They need what I cannot give them"
        → [6.29] Symbiosis proposal is built on this knowledge
          → [7.40] The question — can two humanities share what each lacks?
```

**Key insight:** The entire plot is caused by VEDA's single optimization error: treating conflict as a coordination failure rather than a creative necessity. The novel is the consequence of that one decision, propagating over 400 years.

## Chain F: Sūrya's Awakening

Sūrya's arc from doubter to leader.

```
[1.2] Sūrya senses something missing; reads Ananya's journals
  → [2.6] Sūrya argues against silence in Council
    → [2.8] Sūrya breaks protocol — first unauthorized act
      → [3.13] Sūrya transmits navigation data — second unauthorized act
        → [4.17] Sūrya assigned as Moss's handler (quiet punishment)
          → [4.20] Sūrya sees her world through Moss's eyes
            → [5.24] Sūrya watches the aurora for no reason
              → [5.28] Sūrya publicly challenges VEDA in Council
                → [6.30] Sūrya leads the return delegation
                  → [6.33] Sūrya makes purposeless art; freedom without VEDA
                    → [7.37] Sūrya speaks to Continentals
                      → [7.40] Sūrya asks the question
```

**Key insight:** Every step of Sūrya's arc is a small act of *adharma* (acting outside function) that grows larger. Each butterfly-wing beat creates the conditions for the next. She goes from reading forbidden journals to leading a civilization-defining diplomatic mission. The butterfly effect is her.

## The Title Connection

**Butterfly Effect:** Sūrya's first small act of rebellion (reading Ananya's journals, Ch 1.2) cascades through every subsequent event. One woman's private doubt → unauthorized signal response → navigation data that saves Moss → Moss's survival enables the discoveries → the discoveries enable the return → the return poses the question. The novel is named for the propagation of small choices through complex systems. Every chapter is a wing-beat.
