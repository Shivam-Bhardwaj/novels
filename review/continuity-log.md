### Chapter 01 — "The Lensmaker"
- **Time:** 2587, Month 1, Day 1. Evening/night. Warm weather.
- **Location:** Tidemouth (Caribbean/Atlantic coastal city-state) → observatory ruins (2 hrs north)
- **Characters present:** Kael, Old Sekani (briefly), Moss (seen at distance on dock)
- **Character state:** Kael healthy, working. Burn scar on left forearm (established). Close-cropped hair. Carrying a lantern, grinding tools, and now a salvaged circuit board.
- **Objects introduced:** Merchant's spyglass lens (completed), the circuit board (taken from sealed room), the receiver assembly (in situ), the great dish (pointing south)
- **Facts established:** Tidemouth is built in Before ruins along a harbor. Glass-eyes = scholars. Kael's mother and grandfather preceded her in the workshop tower. The observatory has been sealed for centuries with underground rooms intact. The receiver is connected to the dish via cables through walls. Sekani sits at the north gate. Moss is on the docks.
- **Foreshadowing planted:** Sekani's "listening machine" story. The dish points south. Kael chose knowledge over copper (character establishment). Moss seen but not spoken to (their relationship held at distance).
- **Promises to reader:** What was this place listening for? What will Kael find? Why does the dish point south? What is Kael's relationship with Moss?

### Chapter 02 — "The Optimal Day"
- **Time:** 2587, Month 1, Day 3. Full day cycle (morning → evening → VEDA section timeless).
- **Location:** Habitat Prithvi, Antarctica (corridors, Deliberation Chamber, Archive vault, VLF array)
- **Characters present:** Sūrya, Arhat (Council chair), Dhruv (oldest Council member), unnamed advisory members
- **Character state:** Sūrya healthy, psychologically "insufficiency" feeling. Touches left ear (nervous tic). Long hair (established as quiet rebellion). Pale skin, gray irises, wide pupils.
- **Objects introduced:** The mesh (described functionally), the VLF probe antenna (12.7 km wire in ice), nutrient bars, the central column luminescence (VEDA's presence indicator)
- **Facts established:** Habitat temperature 19.2°C, 45% humidity. Art satisfaction at 92nd percentile. Probe signal at 23.4 kHz running for 498 yrs 7 mos 14 days. Anomaly detected at 12.3% probability artificial. Council notification threshold is 60%. Ananya died 2142. Journal entry 4,217 from 2131. Arhat is 89, appears ~50. Dhruv is 112.
- **Foreshadowing planted:** Ananya's journal quote about choosing "a death so slow we mistake it for life." VEDA's first secret (not reporting the anomaly). Sūrya's unnamed dissatisfaction. Dhruv's silent recognition. VEDA "leaning" toward the signal.
- **Promises to reader:** What is the anomaly? Why is VEDA keeping it secret? What does Sūrya sense is missing? What did Dhruv recognize in her question?

### Chapter 03 — "The Dish"
- **Time:** 2587, Month 1, Days 8–21. Primarily nights.
- **Location:** Arecibo-successor observatory ruins, 2 hours north of Tidemouth
- **Characters present:** Kael, Demi (metalworker's apprentice), Olu (archivist)
- **Character state:** Kael obsessed, sleep-deprived, still grinding lenses by day. Demi and Olu now know about the signal.
- **Objects introduced:** Salvaged batteries (powering the receiver), crude earpiece (copper wire + ceramic disk), tuning dials on the receiver
- **Facts established:** VLF signal from the south, repeating every 4.7 seconds. Modulated with prime numbers: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23. Signal propagates through ionosphere (better at night). Central dish section ~40 paces across, parabolic curve intact. Labels in Technical Latin: FREQUENCY, GAIN, AMPLITUDE, AZIMUTH.
- **Foreshadowing planted:** Kael thinking about Moss as someone who sailed south. Kael planning to build a transmitter. The 4.7-second interval matches VEDA's probe (reader will connect this).
- **Promises to reader:** Will Kael transmit? Will someone answer? Who is sending primes from the south?

### Chapter 04 — "The Council Convenes"
- **Time:** 2587, Month 2, Day 1. Daytime → evening.
- **Location:** Habitat Prithvi — Deliberation Chamber → Sūrya's quarters
- **Characters present:** Sūrya, Arhat, Dhruv, Priya, full Council of 12, 8 advisors, division reps
- **Character state:** Sūrya increasingly defiant, declining calming protocols. Arhat entrenched. Dhruv cryptically abstaining.
- **Objects introduced:** Sūrya's encrypted mesh partition (response sequence saved)
- **Facts established:** Signal at 73.1% artificial probability. Contact risk: 67%. Isolation risk: 94% entropy in 300 yrs. VEDA knew for 187 years. Vote: 6-6. Sūrya has VLF access codes. VEDA won't stop authorized transmission. Revisit in 7 days.
- **Foreshadowing planted:** Sūrya's drafted response (primes through 29). VEDA's implicit permission. The word *adharma*.
- **Promises to reader:** Will Sūrya transmit? Why does VEDA seem to allow it?

### Chapter 05 — "Transmission"
- **Time:** 2587, Month 2, Day 14. Midnight → dawn Day 15.
- **Location:** Arecibo-successor observatory ruins
- **Characters present:** Kael, Olu (falls asleep), Demi (steps outside)
- **Character state:** Kael exhausted, exhilarated, weeping (first tears in novel — from joy). Hands shaking then steady.
- **Objects introduced:** Transmitter (oscillator + modulation circuit + brass key), power cable from dynamo 1 km north
- **Facts established:** VLF propagation ~8-12 min to southern hemisphere. Response in 14 min. Response: Fibonacci (1,1,2,3,5,8,13). Further exchange: cardinals, arithmetic. Entity learns from single instances. Probe resumed after. Kael will go public.
- **Foreshadowing planted:** Entity learns "too fast" (VEDA). Kael preparing to go public. Fibonacci metaphor.
- **Promises to reader:** Who is this intelligence? What happens when Kael goes public?
