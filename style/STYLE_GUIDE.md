# BUTTERFLY EFFECT — Style Guide

> Last updated: 2026-02-06

## Tone Compass

| Axis | Continental Chapters | Antarctic Chapters |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Emotion | Raw, felt in the body | Deep but structured, felt in the mind |
| Sentences | Jagged, varied, breathing | Clean, rhythmic, flowing |
| Metaphors | Fire, stone, weather, muscle | Light, ice, geometry, circuits |
| Pace | Accelerates under stress | Maintains cadence even in crisis |
| Humor | Dark, gallows, unexpected | Dry, pattern-based, rare |
| Reference authors | Cormac McCarthy, Le Guin | Ted Chiang, Ishiguro |

## Word-Level Rules

- **Favor Anglo-Saxon roots** in Continental chapters (gut, bone, fire, dark, stone)
- **Favor Latinate/technical roots** in Antarctic chapters (optimal, resonance, calibrate, parameter)
- Moss's vocabulary **shifts** across arcs — track this deliberately
- Satya words appear *italicized* with meaning inferable from context. Never footnote them.

## Paragraph Rules

- **Action scenes:** short paragraphs (1-3 sentences), lots of white space
- **Reflection scenes:** longer paragraphs (5-8 sentences), let thoughts build
- **Dialogue-heavy scenes:** rapid-fire exchanges, minimal tags, paragraph breaks per speaker
- **VEDA interludes:** uniform short paragraphs, no variation — the regularity IS the characterization

## Forbidden Words/Phrases

These are banned from the manuscript. Find alternatives.

| Banned | Why |
|--------|-----|
| "suddenly" | Lazy tension |
| "very" / "really" | Empty intensifiers |
| "began to" / "started to" | Just do the thing |
| "seemed to" / "appeared to" | Commit or don't |
| "a chill ran down [his/her] spine" | Cliché |
| "let out a breath [he/she] didn't know [he/she] was holding" | Cliché |
| "orbs" (for eyes) | Genre cliché |
| "smirked" (as dialogue tag) | Overused |
| "whispered" (more than 2x per chapter) | Overused |

## Scene Transition Rules

- Between scenes in the same chapter: use `<hr class="scene-break">` (renders as · · ·)
- Between POVs in dual-POV chapters: use `---` with extra spacing
- Time jumps within a chapter: anchor with a concrete sensory detail in the new moment, don't narrate the gap
- Flashbacks: italicize only the first and last sentence of the flashback. No "she remembered..." framing.

## Numbers and Measurements

- Continental characters use imprecise, human-scale measurements ("three days' walk", "taller than two men")
- Antarctic characters use precise units ("4.7 kilometers", "18.2 degrees")
- This difference is subtle but consistent — it signals worldview through language

## Names

- **Continental names:** short, earthy, often one syllable (Kael, Moss, Brin, Thane)
- **Antarctic names:** Sanskrit-derived, multi-syllabic, meaningful (Sūrya, Dhara, Priya, Ākāsha)
- **VEDA:** always in caps. Never "the VEDA" or "a VEDA" — just "VEDA", like a name, not a thing.

## General Prose Standards

### DO:
- Show, don't tell — especially emotions. Describe the body, not the label. Not "she was angry" → "her knuckles whitened on the lens."
- Use concrete, specific sensory details. Not "it smelled bad" → "the air tasted like copper and rotten eggs."
- Let silences and pauses carry weight. White space is a tool.
- Make every chapter's opening line arresting.
- Make every chapter's closing line haunt.
- Weave science in through character experience, not exposition.
- Trust the reader's intelligence.

### DON'T:
- Info-dump. If a character must explain something, make it cost them.
- Use adverbs in dialogue tags.
- Repeat information the reader already knows.
- Make characters explain their emotions out loud.
- Write "As you know, Bob" dialogue.
- Start chapters with weather descriptions — unless the weather is trying to kill someone.
- Write VEDA as a villain.
- Use exclamation marks in narration. Dialogue: rarely.
- Use semicolons in Continental chapters. Save them for Antarctic prose.

---

## Dialogue Rules

- **Continental characters:** contractions, interruptions, incomplete thoughts, slang, creole expressions.
- **Antarctic characters:** no contractions, complete sentences, occasional Satya words (italicized).
- **Moss (post-modification):** speech gradually shifts from Continental to hybrid. Track deliberately.
- Use only "said" and "asked" for dialogue tags except in rare cases. Let the voice carry.
- Dialogue should do at least two things simultaneously.

---

## Chapter Structure

- **Opening line:** Must earn attention. No throat-clearing.
- **First 200 words:** Establish POV, location, and emotional state.
- **Closing line:** Must haunt. Spend as much time on the last line as on the first.
- Scene breaks: `---` sparingly. Prefer hard cuts.

---

## Science Integration

- Science enters through character experience, not narrator explanation.
- H₂S should be smelled, tasted, felt — the reader learns through the character's body.
- Use `<!-- VERIFY: [question] -->` for uncertain science claims.
- Numbers matter: H₂S at 100 ppm, wave heights of 18 meters, 73% probability. Hard SF readers check.

## Emotional Palette by Arc

| Arc | Dominant emotions | Prose should feel like |
|-----|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Wonder, unease, obsession | A door opening in the dark |
| 2 | Tension, defiance, breakthrough | A wire tightening |
| 3 | Dread, grief, endurance | The ocean — relentless, indifferent |
| 4 | Alienation, fascination, horror | A dream that's too perfect |
| 5 | Melancholy, tenderness, revelation | A mirror — clear, honest, painful |
| 6 | Liberation, vulnerability, anticipation | A held breath |
| 7 | Fear, hope, irresolution | An unanswered question |

---

## Describing Key Elements

### The mesh / VEDA:
- **Continental POV:** describe effects, not mechanics. The mesh is *uncanny* from outside.
- **Antarctic POV:** describe as texture of daily life. Sūrya doesn't notice it like you don't notice breathing — until it's gone.

### Modification:
- Physical changes noticed gradually, not catalogued. Show the cost, not the upgrade.

### The ocean:
- The ocean is a character. Indifferent, beautiful, lethal. It does not care about the plot.
- H₂S scenes: smell (rotten eggs → then nothing), taste (metallic, sweet), speed (minutes to death).

### The pidgin:
- Early scenes: frustrating for the reader too. Let miscommunication land.
- Later scenes: beauty in imprecision — a half-understood word carrying more meaning than a fully understood one.

## What This Novel Is NOT

- Not a dystopia. Antarctica works. That's the point.
- Not a utopia. Antarctica is dying. That's also the point.
- Not a cautionary tale about AI (though it contains caution).
- It is a novel about the **cost of optimization** and the **cost of chaos**, and the impossible hope that two peoples might share the burden.
